Excellent example of a traditional Mwai mask made in the Middle Sepik River region village of Angoram in Papua New Guinea. When not being used for ceremonial purposes masks, such as this example, are displayed in the men&apos;s spirit house or Haus Tambaran. This mask is in superb condition (see images above). Dates from mid to late 20th century.<br>
Hand-painted with natural pigments. Features detailed painting utilizing traditional tribal motifs. Features cowrie shells and smaller nassa shells set in clay around the perimeter of the mask, around the mouth and on sections of the nose extension. All shells are intact. Authentic boar&apos;s tusks set in nose. Cassowary feathers set into the perimeter of the mask. <br>
Can be hung for display by a loop secured at the top of the mask. <br>
<br>
This mask would make an outstanding addition to your Oceanic art collection or the eclectic decor of your home or office.<br>
<br>
Price: $1800<br>
<br>
Located in Modesto in the Central Valley. <br>

The Ghashghai nomads are found in the Fars province in the southwest of Iran and they live in the provinces of Fars, Khuzestan and Southern Isfahan but mostly in the surroundings of Shiraz. They move twice a year, between the winter pasture near the Persian Gulf and the summer pasture up in the Zagros mountains where it is much cooler. During the move it is possible to see the men with their typical round hats, running together with their dogs, large flock of sheep and herds of goats, along the roads swirling with clouds of dust. The women in their colourful clothes move along with the help of donkeys and horses towards new camp grounds. The tents that they live in are often made from goat hair.<br>
<br>
The manufacturing of carpets as well as kilims, bags, ribbons and other decorations is an important contribution to the life of the nomads. The carpets have a typical red-brown ground color. The pattern is tied from memory and often consists of a centrally placed medallion, repeated in all four corners. Humans, four legged animals, birds, trees and flowers are popular elements. Other patterns are collected from fresco and columns in Persepolis (Tacht-e-Jamshid in Persia ) the ceremonial capital<br>",

This is one of the earlier designs from Jens Risom&apos;s company, dating to the mid-late 50&apos;s. These were a little chunkier and more primitive than the later work that followed in the early 60&apos;s. They were made in smaller numbers than the ubiquitous models that followed, which may partly explain their generally higher wood, fitting, and construction quality.  <br><br>
So, these are now fairly rare. In fact, the only real analogue I have seen in person is in Bill Hewlett&apos;s perfectly preserved preserved office at Hewlett-Packard. I&apos;ve included a photo of it in site. 
<br><br>
Note the two shelves included, the pullout shelf, originally for a large electric calculator or small typewriter, and the pullout metal storage tray below. It is in fair/good condition, and easily buffed to very good condition. Please refer to the photos.<br><br>


$900. Please include a phone or text number so I know you are a real person. This is part of a cleaning-out. Please visit my other ads.<br><br><br>

Thank you kindly!<br>

Year: 1965<br>
Excellent condition and very comfortable! Current models retail for $2650. 
This specific piece dates to 1976.<br>

<br>Originally manufactured by the great Italian company, Gavina SpA. Knoll International entered into a relationship with Gavina to introduce their Italian designs to the American market, and then purchased the company. This from the Knoll website:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>After graduating from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1953, Kazuhide Takahama designed the Japanese Pavilion for the Milan Triennale. While supervising the installation, Takahama met Dino Gavina, who invited him to design for his design company, Gavina SpA. Over the next decade, Takahama introduced several designs through Gavina, including a knocked-down storage unit called DaDa and a semi-circular shelving system called GEA.
When Knoll acquired Gavina in 1968, three lounge collections by Takahama -- Marcel, Raymond and Suzanne (named after Takahama&apos;s sister) -- were added to the Knoll portfolio. Only the Suzanne proved popular enough to remain in the catalog. Designed in 1965, the Suzanne embodies Takahama&apos;s acclaimed talent for fusing Eastern and Western design principles. While the materials and detailing were fully modern, the overall effect was one of serenity and simplicity.</blockquote>

ARTIST INFO<br>
Anahata Katkin was born in 1978. An Alaskan-bred, Atlanta based artist and co-founder of PAPAYA! Inc, PAPAYA! Living and Jupiter Row. Which are all independently and family owned. She developed her passion for the arts by trial-and-error discovery.  Anahata creates original paintings, drawings, mixed media pieces and illustrations.  She has woven a heart centered landscape of off-beat icons and illustrations that have comprised the PAPAYA! brand signature aesthetic since it&apos;s beginning in 2003. Anahata is continually inspired to bounce between her life as an artist, mother, entrepreneur, traveler and boutique-maker. The facets of her professional and personal life merge together in what she likes to call &quot;Creative Abandon&quot;. A credo that to her, simply means a life of purpose, passion and creative authenticity rolled into a singular goal.",

<br>
A little about the artist: <br>
<br>
Though he immigrated to the United States in 1987, Zhang Wen Xin still feels connected to his homeland and he travels there every year. Zhang uses his art to promote a better understanding between his adopted home and his birthplace. Zhang&apos;s paintings capture everyday people doing ordinary tasks and hopes to show that there is much we share in our common lives. <br>
<br>
While just a child, Zhang lost his mother and moved to live with his grandparents.  He later fled to Manchuria when the Japanese invaded Tianjin.  In 1959 he earned a degree in oil painting from North China University. he found it difficult to work as an artist and obtained a partial scholarship to study physics at Beijing University.<br>

George Leslie Hunter (7 August 1877 - 7 December 1931) was a Scottish painter, regarded as one of the four artists of the Scottish Colourists group of painters.[1][2] Christened simply George Hunter, he adopted the name Leslie in San Francisco,[3] and Leslie Hunter became his professional name. Showing an aptitude for drawing at an early age, he was largely self-taught, receiving only elementary painting lessons from a family acquaintance. He spent fifteen formative years from the age of fifteen in the USA, mainly in California.[4] He then returned to Scotland, painting and drawing there and in Paris. Subsequently, he travelled widely in Europe, especially in the South of France, but also in the Netherlands, the Pas de Calais and Italy.[4]",

<br>
Erika Perloff is a landscape painter working in the plein air tradition. Born in California, Erika grew up immersed in the rich landscapes of the San Francisco Bay Area: fog shrouded city skylines, crashing surf on jagged headlands, rolling golden hills and the serene sillouette of Mount Tamalpais above the bay. Surrounded by the art of  Bay Area artists such as Leah Schwartz, Judy Klausenstock and Maggie Hazel Rosen, she was  inspired to pick up a brush at an early age, and has been painting ever since.<br>
 <br>
Erika&apos;s education, career and life experiences have kept her almost continuously out of doors, where she has focused her attention and sketchbook on the California landscape. Her background in biology and natural history and work as outdoor educator, park ranger, naturalist, garden educator and classroom teacher have given her a unique perspective as a plein air painter. She approaches the flora, fauna, climate, geology and overall environment with a scientific understanding of the landscape, and yet uses her artistic sensibilities to adjust and interpret the landscape, emphasizing what drew her to the scene.  Her love for hiking and backpacking allows her to paint in out of the way places.<br>
 <br>
Erika has studied painting in intensive workshops with Tobin Keller, Kim Lordier, Colleen Howe, Terri Ford, Bill Cone and Marcia Burtt. <br>
She works in pastel, acrylic, gouache and oil. Her work hangs in many private collections and public spaces and her award winning paintings are shown in group and solo shows.",

<br>
                            Copyright 2015 by Roxanne Wheelis and Forrest Hyde<br>
<br>
                                                          134 pages, spiral bound book<br>
<br>
<br>
     Before Mickey Mouse and Disneyland, Southern California had &quot;The Pike&quot;, often referred to as the &quot;Coney Island of the West&quot;. Although it assumed several names throughout its eighty years of existence, it will always be &quot;The Pike&quot; to most. A family friendly entertainment district featuring carnival rides, arcades, and sideshows along a sprawling boardwalk. &quot;The Pike&quot; was also home to the seedier elements of liquor stores, shady street performers and of course...tatoo shops. It was often these places that provided a much needed distraction for the many servicemen in the area. A small tattoo, (or large if they had time), of &quot;USN&quot; or &quot;USMC&quot; put the final touch on these patriots and became an outward symbol of their transition from boyhood to manhood. Once deployed, thousands were never to return. The days and nights on &quot;The Pike&quot; were the best they would ever spend.<br>
<br>
     This book is not the first of its kind, but it is a previously unpublished collection of authentic designs from an era when &quot;The Pike&quot; was thriving, and specifically from Bert Grimm&apos;s Parlor. Although Bert has long passed, his location at 22 Chestnut Place is still in existence as a tattoo shop and museum. Handed down from one of Bert&apos;s most well known proteges, Bob Shaw, we hope you enjoy this compilation of classic acetate stencils, whose history is as rich and varied as the patrons of that famous place in time that once existed in the golden state.",

Laguna Beach has long been a hot spot for surfers, and the beachfront town was one of the most important spots of the surfer craze of the 1960s. The Retro Surf Laguna Beach Metal Sign pays tribute to the town&apos;s historic surfing past with a design inspired by advertising posters that travel agents once used to sell vacation packages. Created by artist Wade Koniakowsky, the image features a surfer in a retro bathing suit, standing in front of his surfboard. The landscape of Laguna Beach can be seen in the background, and at the bottom, the sign reads &quot;Surf Laguna Beach.&quot;",

ABOUT:<br>
Liquid Hope tastes like a sweet pea soup or can be made into a smoothie using pineapple juice. Adding coconut water works well, too. The product may be used as a soup base. With the addition of other savory ingredients, properly pureed, one can change the flavor. It is not difficult to imagine adding pureed steamed veggies to the soup. This will provide variety and give the user control of the diet, effectively eliminating patient boredom and frustration. This greatly increases the positive psychological element of feeding and nutrition.<br>

Filters are easy to get and very easy to change. They will last for 1,000 gallons and the machine will even tell you when it is time to change it. The DARC system is the reason that this unit will keep producing powerful water in each and every glass. The DARC cleaning system keeps the electrodes clean during EVERY cycle. <br>

<br>
There are thirteen sections covering all aspects of building your custom teardrop camper with almost 200 pages and over 200 color photographs. You will receive the plans, which include for each section a materials list, a tools list, and step by step instructions. Also included is a list of the items I purchased and the supplier I used for each item. What makes these plans so special is that I am including the computer aided design (CAD) files and the link to download the CAD software for free. With this file, you will be able to make detailed measurements and make any changes to the design you desire...and see if it works before spending money on your build. I am also throwing in another set of CAD files showing you how to layout your wood cuts so you minimize waste. Now with separate drafting files in PDF (and xps) format showing the dimensions of almost all components and wood cut layouts without the need to open any CAD files!<br>
<br>
You can see just how big the inside is by looking at the photographs. Not only is the mattress shown 80&quot; long, there is still space between the end of the bed and the closet. Yes, an actual closet inside the camper as well as 6 overhead cabinets that you won&apos;t bang your head or feet on when you get out of bed.",

<br>
These are used tanks that were used for transporting food additives, detergents or liquid nutrients. They are in good condition and have no leaks. They have been emptied but may contain some residue at the bottom.<br>
<br>
They have a galvanized frame, 6 inch cap on top and 2 inch valve at the bottom. They are 40&quot; wide by 48&quot; deep by 45&quot; high and weigh around 120 pounds each.<br>
<br>
They may be stacked up to 3 high while full and have a built in pallet for use with a forklift.<br>
<br>
I use them for aquaponics but they would be suitable for most kinds of water and other liquid storage. They are well suited for rain water collection as they have a cap for filling at the top and a valve that may be adapted to a hose at the bottom.<br>
<br>
The IBC Totes are $125 each.<br>

I also have 55 gallon plastic and metal barrels for $25.<br>

<br>
This pump has a new HP75CN head with a used 115/230 VAC motor, was kept in a store room as a spare - never used after the rebuild by Bruce Barton Pump Service in San Jose, CA<br>
<br>
Price Pump Company is a premier manufacturer of Centrifugal pumps with over 82 years of experience and the pump can cover a very wide range of liquid pumping applications.<br>
<br>
All centrifugal pumps include a shaft-driven impeller that rotates inside a casing. Liquid flows into the suction port (inlet) of the casing and is thrown to the outside of the casing and then exits the discharge port. The velocity imparted to the liquid by the impeller is converted to pressure energy or &quot;head&quot;.<br>
<br>
Centrifugal pumps are unique because they can provide high flow rates and varies considerably with changes in the Total Dynamic Head (TDH) of the particular piping system.<br>
<br>
This allows the flow rate &quot;throttled&quot; considerably with a simple valve placed into the discharge piping, without causing excessive pressure buildup in the piping or requiring a pressure relief valve.<br>
<br>
Therefore, centrifugal pumps can cover a very wide range of liquid pumping applications to transport water like circulating chilled water, as a booster pump, sprinklers or filling a holding tank.<br>
<br>
Most centrifugal pumps are not self-priming; the casing must be filled with liquid before the pump is started.<br>
<br>
The motor is wired as 115 VAC, you can change to 230 VAC<br>
<br>
Both the Impeller and the Volute are CPVC and flows to 20 GPM which max pressure energy or &quot;head&quot; at 160 feet<br>

                  description: "Become a Franchise Owner<br>
<br>
FireMaster&#xAE; directly provides fire suppression system and equipment installation and service in fourteen (14) different regions of nine states - Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. The overwhelming majority of this business involves services provided by FireMaster&#xAE; technicians who are franchise owners. In general, a FireMaster&#xAE; service franchisee purchases the right to perform a specific category of fire protection services to customers of FireMaster&#xAE; located within an exclusive geographic territory defined by zip codes.  Franchisees perform services using our model and procedures at our customers&apos; facilities, according to applicable federal, state and local laws or regulations and industry standards.  A franchise is granted for one or more categories including portable extinguishers, kitchen system service, kitchen exhaust cleaning, Exit and Emergency lights service, Extinguisher training, and Industrial systems service.<br>
<br>
What does it mean to be a Franchise Owner?<br>
<br>
It means you are self-employed and free to work as hard as you want to make the living you deserve. FireMaster&#xAE; provides you with back office administrative, clerical and bookkeeping support and assistance which allow you to focus on delivery of professional, quality services to existing customers and to solicit new business in your territory. You must perform all services according to  all federal, state and local &quot;AHJ&quot; (authority having jurisdiction) laws and regulations, standards or guidelines, including the National Fire Protection Association (&quot;NFPA&quot;), International Fire Code and other industry codes that may apply. You will obtain the proper state or local licenses or certifications, including manufacturers&apos; certifications,  for the type services you will provide.  You must also adhere to all FireMaster&#xAE; procedures and operating guidelines in delivering the services. If you grow and need assistance then you may hire employees to assist you in providing services and expanding your revenues and market penetration within your authorized territory. Generally, you manage your own work yourself.<br>
<br>
You turn in your completed work weekly to the local office and all processing and invoicing is handled by FireMaster&#xAE;.  You will receive a percentage of the revenues generated from your services provided to customers at the agreed gross profits percentage contained in your franchise agreement.  This percentage share of revenues varies based on the subcategory of services you provide.  We record and report to you multiple times each week the results of your franchise operations based on the invoicing of weekly turn-ins you provide us and the expenses incurred for Sales Orders issued for products you purchase from us.<br>
<br>
After years of operating your franchise business and growing your franchise territory, your FireMaster&#xAE; franchise may develop value as a going business concern. Your FireMaster&#xAE; franchise agreement allows a franchisee, in compliance with certain conditions or requirements, to sell, assign or transfer the franchise agreement and territory to a qualified, competent and licensable party who is capable of performing the required fire protection services and successfully operating the franchise business.<br>
<br>
If you are a licensed fire suppression technician or mechanically inclined and seeking greater opportunities, a FireMaster&#xAE; service franchise may be right for you. Generally, other than securing appropriate licenses or certifications, all that is required is an appropriate service vehicle and standard tools and equipment for performing the designated services.  Please see below for how you can obtain further information about a potential FireMaster&#xAE; franchise opportunity. <br>
<br>
More Information:<br>
FireMaster&#xAE; regularly offers a 30 minute webinar that discusses how the franchise program works.  After the webinar you can converse with the company about opportunities in your area.<br>
<br>
After it is determined that you may be a good fit for the program we may offer to send you our &quot;FireMaster&#xAE; Franchise Disclosure Document&quot; (&quot;FDD&quot;).  The FDD is like an investment &quot;prospectus&quot; and describes certain required information about the Company, our officers and managers, our business experience and operations and the nature of the franchise opportunity that is available. It also contains discussion of the potential risks involved in investing in such a business and the nature and amount of initial capital or investment that might be required to purchase a franchise and begin operations. <br>
<br>
New franchise opportunities are available in Bay Area. <br>

<br>
Diesel Hybrid Steam Cleaner FORTADOR PRO S  is powered by a powerful Lamborghini burner. Giving both a steam cleaning and washing function, with the ability to provide detergent for cleaning wheels and engine or commercial cleaning. The steam is at a pressure of 16 Bar or 232 PSI, for use with Car Wash, upholstery steam wash, vacuum and much more. All enclosed in a single casing, of modern design and made of ecological and corrosion free resistant aluminium alloy. Fortador is built upon many years of our manufacturing experience and it is probably the most powerful mobile steam cleaner on the market. Our bestselling model is the answer to our customer needs.<br>
<br>
Fortador PRO S  has the ability to apply detergent with steam at the same time. The 7-inch touchscreen display shows current fluids level (water, diesel, detergent), current pressure in the boiler, serial number, an hour meter and much more. The heart of Fortador PRO S is the boiler and the burner, it is custom made for us by a world-class manufacturer - Lamborghini. The highest quality of the combustion system and low diesel consumption enables even faster return on investment. The additional power control in the range of 16.6 - 36.6 kW allows us to set operating pressure at 16 bars (235 PSI).",

Extremely well taken care of. I&apos;ve owned it for about 10 years, I believe I am the 2nd owner. Purchased it in Spokane, Washington with about 35,000 miles on it. I&apos;ve been using it in my business ever since and it has been the most versatile limo I have ever owned. It was sold to me as a 16 passenger, but it is only comfortable with 16 if most of them are kids. I used it as a 14 passenger for many years and it was a perfect fit. About two years ago I purchased a huge Hummer out of Reno so I changed the Excursion to a 12 passenger or a 10 passenger. I mostly did that for competition with my local competitors. You can look on my website, I made it look like I have two different Excursions, lol. <br>
<br>

<br>
This limo has had a lot of great times with us (my favorite is when it did the Extreme Home Makeover with Tye Pennington), but now it is time to let someone else enjoy it. If you have any questions please shoot me a text or give me a call... or email if you are ok with a bit of a slower reply. 541-8five7-88two8<br>
<br>
The limo is located in Medford, Or which is about 20 minutes north of the California border on I-5. I am not selling it locally for I would just be creating competition for my business. If you are interested come check it out in person when you are ready.<br>
<br>
Here are some of the specs which I got off the VIN check... which I can send to you if you are interested.<br>

Not a show car but in great condition for a 49 year old car. It has had 1 paint job the original color, maybe close to 30 years ago, a few small dents and dings. The original vinyl top in great condition. with NO RUST under it. Always a California car with almost no rust (a couple minor spots at the bottom of front fender, but easily repairable) Interior is in good condition, headliner, carpet, door panels  all good, rear seat is very nice. Front seat leather is soft and repairable but left all original, glass is all good, all power windows, seats, locks, are in working condition. Tires have 50% left but aren&apos;t matched and a new set would be good if you want to drive all the time. Engine, trans, brakes are good. When taken out of storage radiator was leaking so I installed a new high performance aluminum radiator, water pump, new belts and hoses. Minor oil leak at the valve cover. But very easy to make a &quot;driver&quot; still gets lots of looks and thumbs up. Paint has a nice patina. Chrome on bumpers is a little week, I can include nice original front and rear bumpers. It is a great color combination and has a really good look the way it is. Senior owner must sell. Please be nice, no scammers, I don&apos;t need help selling. Some lucky person will love this car.

<br>
-Car had one other owner <br>
-Passed smog 01/25/2019<br>
-Clean title in hand<br>
-Wheels, brakes, exhaust, and timing belt changed a few thousand miles ago<br>
<br>
<br>
Extra perks of this car:<br>
<br>
-People don&apos;t cut you off on the road :)<br>
-Never get pulled over in a Pathfinder, just doesn&apos;t happen often<br>
-4 wheel drive (off roading everywhere around)<br>
-Lots of storage<br>
-Boss sound system<br>
<br>
Cons: (See pictures)<br>
<br>
-Car has minor rust damage, near the step ramp, side mirrors, windshield top. (Lived by the beach in Ventura)<br>
-Windshield is cracked in two places (completely functional doesn&apos;t need a new one, but costs is minimal to replace)<br>
-Older car, but best value. I&apos;d imagine getting 50,000-75,000 more miles out of this SUV before anything very important needs to be worked on.<br>
<br>
Spoke to my mechanic at 195,000 recommended changing left ball joint, and water pump within 10,000 miles.<br>
<br>
<br>
All in all it is a fun, unique, and cheap car that gets the job done.<br>

                  description: "Please read full description before contacting me. I like to be fully transparent when selling so everything I can think of about the car will be listed in the ad. Thank you!<br>
<br>
Selling my 1995 BMW E36 M3 - 5 speed manual coupe. Bought just a few months ago. Selling because I recently jumped on a deal for a 2006 M3 that I&apos;d like to build, and I can&apos;t justify building two M3&apos;s right now. <br>
<br>
CLEAN TITLE. 182k miles. 100% smog legal. Just passed a few months ago. <br>
<br>
This car has about $7,000 in mods that have less than a couple hundred miles on them. All installed professionally (mod list below). I planned on using this car as a track car, but my plans changed since picking up my new M3. <br>
<br>
Mechanically: the car is solid. It was taken to Performance Technic in Fremont for a PPI and was given a good report. Has a small oil leak that was diagnosed by Performance Technic. Was told it is something that should be taken care of eventually, but not an issue for the time being.<br>
<br>
Cosmetically: The car has issues. The paint isn&apos;t in great shape. Lots of little nicks and scratches. Clear coat peeling a bit on passenger door. I was much more focused on the car being mechanically solid rather than it looking like a show car since I planned on tracking it. Its a 24 year old car. Its not going to be perfect. If you&apos;re looking for a super clean E36, this isn&apos;t it.<br>
<br>
If you are looking for a comfortable daily driver, this isn&apos;t for you. However, it is EXCELLENT in the environment it was set up for. Handles fantastically and performs great. <br>
<br>
Mods: All mods have less than a couple hundred miles on them and were installed professionally by Performance Technic. Mods were around $7k + another $2k for install.<br>
- Brand new UUC short shift kit. <br>
- Brand new Apex Arc-8 wheels (17x9 square). <br>
- Brand new Bridgestone RE71-RR tires (245 square).<br>
- Brand new BC adjustable coil overs. <br>
- Brand new Turner Motorsport sway bar kit w/ adjustable end links. <br>
- Brand new Sparco P300 steering wheel. <br>
- Brand new polly motor mounts.<br>
- JB sport headers (installed by previous owner). Smog legal + they have a carb sticker. <br>
<br>
*WILL NOT PART OUT* If you are interested in the parts, consider buying the car. The cost of parts + labor for just mods alone came out to the same as I&apos;m selling the whole car for. I&apos;m taking a huge loss. It really is a great deal. <br>
<br>
Cons: <br>
- Handbrake mechanism is jammed. Needs to be fixed if the E-brake is a must for you (has been parked in my flat garage in first gear, so has not been a problem for me). <br>
- Speaker system isn&apos;t working. Has an amp/speakers, but you&apos;ll need to either take it into a sound shop or if you&apos;re handy rewire it yourself. Again, this is something I wasn&apos;t concerned about since it was my track build. <br>
- No rear seats. <br>
<br>
Notes:<br>
- 245 tires ended up being a bit wide and rub a bit. However, the coilovers were installed so recently that I never had a chance to bring the car back in for a height adjustment after the springs settled. This problem should be easily fixed by raising the rear ride height a bit. Fitment in the front is perfect. <br>
<br>
$8,200 cash or cashiers check ONLY. PRICE IS FIRM. I am aware that some things needs fixing, so please don&apos;t come to look at the car just to list everything that needs fixing then lowball me. I&apos;ve listed all of the issues with the car in the ad, so if you don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth $8,200, lets not waste either of our time. If you are SERIOUSLY interested, please email me by clicking &quot;reply&quot; at the top of the page (too many sales calls when I give out my # on CL). If you include your name and number, I will reply promptly.<br>
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to read the full ad. It may seem like a lot, but I&apos;m just saying what a lot of other sellers will neglect to tell you :-)",

Reluctantly selling my GTI due to medical reasons/bills. I love this car and it was very difficult to find in this set-up. <br>
It is black (&quot;Black Magic&quot;, has some pearl) with black leather interior (Charcoal grey). It has the shiftable DSG (automatic) transmission with Launch Control &amp; paddle shifters.<br>
It has custom 17&quot; rims with good tires and TPMS. Besides the rims, the only thing I&apos;ve &quot;modified&quot; was to add some carbon fiber pieces: front lip/chin spoiler, side mirrors, headlight eyebrows, and rear spoiler. All these bits were available in plastic, but I opted for, the much more expensive, carbon fiber. Additionally, I replaced the front grill with the emblem delete version. I also added European taillights and front black LED marker/bumper lights. I have all the original parts you can have also. It also has both sets of floormats, winter and summer (rubber &amp;/or carpet, which I&apos;ve not yet used). Car has less than 83xxx miles (that&apos;s barely 8k per year). Also comes with front/hood bra, which I never put on. I did synthetic oil change last month and tyranny fluid change awhile back (have 5 more liters of fluid you can have).<br>
Never raced, abused, or otherwise mechanically modified or altered.<br>
***Please note: Car is in Redding, which is about 3.5 hours North of San Francisco, up I-5. Car is also currently financed through Toyota, as I bought it at San Francisco Toyota.<br>
I will not respond to low ball offers. Nor will I acknowledge obvious spammers &amp; scammers.<br>

I have spent about $13k on this Subie &amp; the owner before me had a good $10k into it. This car absolutely screams when it runs. One of a kind wrx. Very very mean! My plans were to build up the brand new short block I purchased through Subaru &amp; drop it in. I&apos;m in need of funds at the moment so the car unfortunately has to go. By far one of my favorite cars I&apos;ve owned. It Just needs another short block dropped in &amp; you&apos;re ready to roll. The car made 357awhp last time it was on the dyno. Car screams &amp; pulls very hard when running! I&apos;m asking $4,200 as is the way it sits. Also have a brand new in the box bare short block(needs rods, pistons etc..) that can be included for a package deal. Email, call or text if interested or would like any more info, thanks<br>

It has been our extra car for a few years and although we didn&apos;t need it we had a hard time deciding to sell it because it is so comfortable to ride in. Was primarily used to take my mother in law to her doctors appointments for the last few years because it was easy to get her in and out of and the trunk is huge and easily fit her wheelchair. <br>
<br>
The car starts right up, runs excellent and has never been in an accident. Don&apos;t need to sell, just got tired of paying insurance and registration on a car we don&apos;t need. It just passed smog with no issues. Registration is paid current. I have pink slip and clean Carfax report in hand. Please no low ball offers and I do not need help selling.Thanks for looking. Text or call if you are interested or have any questions. <br>

                  description: "Great commuter car, selling it because our family is upgrading to a minivan.  I&apos;m the second owner (purchased it a bit over 2 years ago from a dealer selling it post-lease).  No exterior or interior damage.<br>
<br>
It&apos;s a great car, fun to drive - I love the responsiveness compared to a gas car, and it is especially zippy under 50mph and plenty capable over that.  <br>
<br>
The battery has 10 of the original 12 bars, slightly above average for a 2012 Leaf.  It gets a solid 45-50mi with highway driving (though 45 might be the max if it&apos;s cold) and a little more if you&apos;re driving at a lower speed.  My commute is about 35mi round trip and I usually have 10-15mi left when I get home.   I drove it 65 mi once and had the unenviable experience of actually having it stop going 1/2mi from home!<br>
<br>
I usually have charged it with level 1 at home, 110v, and for my normal commute 10-12 hours charging does the trick (allowing me to take good advantage of time-of-use electricity cost).  I also researched and installed a level 2 charger at home for my other car, and I&apos;m happy to give some advice on this topic, as it reduces the charging time a lot.<br>
<br>
The SL package includes Rear camera, fog lights, automatic headlights, a solar panel on the rear spoiler to charge the 12v battery, Quick charge port (CHAdeMO) and more.  I replaced the 12v battery a couple months ago.<br>
<br>
Reg. paid through November 2019.<br>
<br>
I&apos;m attaching a recent screenshot from the Leaf Spy app.  I got the ODBII Bluetooth interface to use Leaf Spy and it was pretty useful in understanding battery usage better - happy to send it with you.<br>",

The assembly New line style of mass production and Belmont interchangeable SE AWD parts had Redwood been pioneered in the U.S. by Thomas Stinson Like Blanchard Ashland in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. This Elkhorn concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1913 with the world&apos;s first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.nAs a result, Ford&apos;s cars came Sunol Front off the line MONEY in fifteen-minute Valley intervals, New Pescadero, much faster than Tamalpais GMC, previous Ap. methods, increasing buy New productivity eightfold, MILES, while / / using less manpower (from 12.5-man-hours to 1 hour Castro 33 minutes). It was so successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only Felton Japan Black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop Seats the variety of colors available dealers, before 1913, until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford&apos;s apocryphal fair remark, &quot;any color as long as it&apos;s black&quot;. In 1914, an / assembly line / worker could buy a Model T with four months&apos; Today pay.nFord&apos;s complex safety 4 proceduresespecially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing Bad them to roam aboutdramatically reduced the rate of injury. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called &quot;Fordism,&quot; and was copied by REBATE, most major industries. drivetime, The efficiency COUPE, Doors, gains from the assembly line also models coincided with the economic rise / of the United States.

Soon, companies had / to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared.nDevelopment of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small Finance manufacturers competing to gain the world&apos;s attention. Key developments included $0 Fast Credit electric ignition and the electric / self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 19101911), independent Loan suspension, and four-wheel brakes.nSince the 1920s, nearly all / cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was use, Alfred 2013 Used P. Sloan who established the idea of different makes / of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers house, could &quot;move up&quot; as their fortunes 2002 improved.nReflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared hood, doors, roof, Used and windows with Pontiac; cheap, by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms 1998 Like (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left.nIn Europe, much the same would happen.

Approved Lawson&apos;s truck, Ramon company use, / / made its 1990 first car in 1897, and they New bore the name Daimler.nIn Mount 1892, German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a &quot;New Rational Combustion Engine&quot;. Emeryville In 1897, espanol he built the first diesel engine. Steam-, Acres electric-, Stockton and San gasoline-powered vehicles competed Exterior Landing for decades, with Cheap gasoline internal DOWN, time, combustion / engines Komandorski wagon. 4dr achieving dominance in the 1910s. Although various pistonless Madera rotary engine Brookdale designs have attempted used to compete with Walnut the conventional piston and Park no crankshaft design, only Import Mazda&apos;s Lathrop version Sky of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited Broadmoor Drive Newman success.nAll in all, it is estimated that over 100,000 patents created the modern automobile and motorcycle.nnnMass LOW productionnnLarge-scale, production-line manufacturing Monte of affordable cars was started by Ransom Kilkare credit Olds in 1901 at his 2003 / Oldsmobile factory in Lansing, Michigan Group and Seaside based upon PAYMENTS, stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in Wheel 1802. The assembly Sobrante line style of mass FUEL production Muir and interchangeable Rafael parts had been pioneered Woods in the Ridgemark U.S. by Thomas Crockett Blanchard in 1821, at pre-owned Vehicle the Doon Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. This concept was greatly Motors expanded by Henry Ford, beginning 1992 in 1913 with the world&apos;s first moving assembly San line for cars at the Highland / / Park Gatos Wheel Ford Plant.nAs a result, 4WD Ford&apos;s cars came off the line in fifteen-minute intervals, DOWN, much faster than Mar previous methods, Passport increasing productivity no, Vista eightfold, Alamo while Gilroy using less credito, manpower (from suv 12.5-man-hours Oakland / to 1 hour 33 minutes). It was Juan so mid-size successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only Japan Black Palo would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of / colors available before 1913, until fast-drying Duco car lacquer was developed Morgan in 1926. This is the source of Ford&apos;s apocryphal remark, &quot;any color 0, as long as it&apos;s black&quot;. In 1914, an assembly line worker vans, could buy a Model T with four months&apos; van, pay.nFord&apos;s complex safety / proceduresespecially assigning each worker to a specific location instead French of allowing them Novato to roam Diablo aboutdramatically reduced the Del rate of injury. / The combination of Moss / high wages SINGLE, Castro and high efficiency is called &quot;Fordism,&quot; no and Automotive was copied / by most Clean major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic Beach Port rise of Low the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other drive INSTANT Miles countries were using less productive Carfax methods.nIn the automotive industry, its Aromas success REBATE, was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing used the founding of Ford all France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, Citroen was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, Clean or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, $1,0 had disappeared.nDevelopment 2006 of automotive technology / was rapid, cheap due in part Diesel to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world&apos;s attention. Key BEACON, reliable developments included electric Certified 1994 ignition time and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 19101911), dealerships, independent suspension, and four-wheel Seating brakes.nSince the Like 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced Car Bad to meet market needs, so marketing plans often INSTANT, have heavily influenced car design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who Motors established Pick / the idea of different makes For of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Pre Make BHPH Program, so that buyers could &quot;move up&quot; as their fortunes improved.nReflecting the rapid pace of change, 1998 makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. Application For Credit example, MONEY, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, / used cheaper Sign mechanical mal, parts made by Oldsmobile; / in Cheap the 1950s, Chevrolet shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) / were common. Even so, only major 2001 makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some Today two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived Check in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left.nIn Europe, much the same Apply would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford&apos;s practice of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41% of total British car production. Most British 2018 small-car assemblers, from Abbey to Xtra, had gone under. Citroen did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault&apos;s 10CV and Peugeot&apos;s 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and Mors, Hurtu, and others could not compete. Germany&apos;s first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), came off the line at </p><p>*Monthly payment based on 30% Down for 84 months at 7.9% APR financing On Approved Credit.

                  description: "Hello,<br>
<br>
I am selling my 2008 Audi A3.  It has been gently driven by 2 female drivers, myself and the previous owner.  I have maintenance records to show what has been completed over the last few years.  Most of the work was done at German Car Service in Oakland.  Super fun to drive and has a beautiful, panoramic roof.  Clean title, no accidents, and paint is good.  Some scratches on back bumper.  <br>
<br>
I am pricing it at fair condition for a quick sale.  Needs a little love to make it perfect.  Some minor issues include a passenger airbag light on, a/c hasn&apos;t worked in awhile.  Happy to meet you at a mechanic at your own cost if you&apos;d like the car inspected before purchase.  I am not aware of any major issues but due to mileage and age of the car, there may be maintenance coming up.  Haven&apos;t driven the car much lately, so will probably need some tuning up. I&apos;ll bring the records so you can review what&apos;s already been done.  Car mileage is 154k currently.<br>
<br>
** Ski racks not included. **<br>
<br>
Some additional features to note:<br>
- light gray leather interior<br>
- heated seats<br>
- power seats<br>
- comes with 2 sets of keys<br>
<br>
Please call for an appointment.  I will not set up any appointments without speaking to you first.  I live in Daly City and work in Concord.  I can show the car during business hours in Concord.<br>

-67k miles<br>

-No accidents and clean title<br>
-There are a couple dings on the rear bumper from parking lot bumps shown in the pictures<br>
-Well maintained, no mechanical issues with the car<br>
-The front doors make an awful noise right as the window closes (once it gets to the very top). It&apos;s a common problem with these cars due to the type of actuator inside the door used for the window, causes no issues, never gets stuck just unpleasant noise. You can test it yourself if you take a look at it. <br>
-Interior is in reasonable condition, a few stains from previous owner and what looks like a cigarette burn (I do not smoke so the car doesn&apos;t smell)<br>
<br>
I have listed all the minor imperfections of the car above so that there are no surprises when you come take a look at the car. I am open to reasonable offers. Selling to upgrade to a truck. <br>

This car is optioned with the cold weather package (heated seats, headlight washers, ski sack) and heated steering wheel, as well as the upgraded sound system, but thankfully doesn&apos;t have the navigation system to remind you just how bad infotainment systems were in the early 2000&apos;s.<br>

BMW sold fewer than 500 540i wagons in the US for the 2003 model year. 2003 was the last and best year of the highly-regarded e39 5-series.<br>

SALVAGE: The Jeep was stolen in 2006 from a previous owner. When it was recovered, it was missing the top, seats, carpet, and wheels and was deemed salvaged by the insurance company. All parts were replaced. I have CarFax report and lots of maintenance records. <br>
<br>
I have owned this Jeep for 5 years and have loved it! No leaks, no rust. Engine runs great.<br>

I am the second owner of this JEEP. I purchased last year from the original owner with 135k miles, whom used mostly to tow behind their Motorhome ... a high percentage of those 135k miles were &quot;Towed Miles&quot;. This was my main reason for purchasing this JEEP ... it was never was abused.<br>
I built what you see in the photos this past year. When I purchased the JEEP it did have the 2.5&quot; PRO-Comp Lift ... all the rest of accessories are what I have purchased and installed. I also did an entire &quot;Fluid Change&quot;, which I&apos;ve put a whole 1500 miles on it since.<br>
Everything works, performs well on/off the road or highway, and is in great shape ... no rust or body/frame damage with the exception of a few and usual Jeep-dings.<br>
I have just moved and sadly don&apos;t have the room to keep ... I am asking for $8,500/obo.<br>
<br>
I also have a &quot;Rough Country 2.5 X-Series Suspension Lift Kit&quot;, still in the Boxes. My plan was to remove the current PRO-Comp Lift and replace it with the RC-lift. This new RC-Lift is more off-road capable. I purchased the new Lift for $1000, and would consider possibly selling seperatly for $850/obo. But would prefer to be a part of a negotiated total purchase of the JEEP TJ, above.<br>

Up for sale is a super clean mint RX350. Everything is in great condition. No rips, stains, tear, dings, or scratches anywhere I could see. It got a face lift of the F-Sport aggressive look, was a $3500 upgrade. I drove the F--Sport and suspension was too rough and bumpy. So I opt for the smooth suspension of the normal RX350, with the aggressive look of the F-Sport so I got the best of both worlds by with the conversation. The car is fully loaded! <br>

Harry Rowohlt, &quot;Der Paganini der Abschweifung&quot; live, 2 Audio-CDs [audioCD]<br>
Als Vorleser begonnen hat Rowohlt f&#xFC;r den &#xF6;ffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunk, als es H&#xF6;rb&#xFC;cher gemeinhin nur in der Blindenbibliothek oder als Kinderschallplatten gab - und das Wort schon gleich gar nicht. Heute sind etliche seiner &#xDC;bersetzungen - nat&#xFC;rlich selbst gelesen - als Konserve verf&#xFC;gbar, denn wann hat man als Verlag (und Harry Rowohlt begl&#xFC;ckt, wie man schon erfahren hat, viele Verlage) schon einmal das Gl&#xFC;ck, ein Multitalent im Programm zu haben? So wird es immer &#xE4;rger mit Harry, und wir haben das Vergn&#xFC;gen daran. Der neueste Mitschnitt einer Lesung tr&#xE4;gt zu Recht den Titel &quot;Der Paganini der Abschweifung&quot;.<br>

For one of my dogs, I made this homemade Groot headpiece (You can see how it turned out in the photos). It has cut out pieces to match the bark on Groot&apos;s head in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie. I also hot glued on some pieces of plastic evergreen needles to match the roots and whatnot that he had sticking off his head. It has an elastic piece that goes around the neck to keep the hat on. It can be used for a dog, cat or human! All that needs to be adjusted in the string that goes around the neck if it is too tight or loose. The colors were hand painted onto the bark.

<br>
From Sea to Shining Sea Lighthouse August Holland <br>
<br>
19 BY 27<br>
<br>
August Holland was born June 23, 1928 in Sublette , Illinois . <br>
Holland&apos;s interest in art began at about the age of six. At the age of fifteen August&apos;s first published work appeared in &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine. After high school he went to the American Academy of Art in Chicago. When he finished art school, a job was waiting for him at an advertising agency in Mendota. Spare time was devoted to fine art. Two years later he was called into the service. Being an artist, he was asked to do the art work for propaganda to the Latin American countries. His first one-man show was held at the El Panama Hotel, and several months later he had another one-man show at the Jewish League in Panama. After his tour of duty, August returned to Mendota.<br>
During his early years as an artist, he was in the Ivan Soritch Gallery and the Edgewater Beach Gallery in Chicago. Goes Lithographing in Chicago liked his work and commissioned him to do many paintings. August had many pseudonyms from Boise Smith to Sasha Khomoran. Holland&apos;s work has been exhibited in several galleries across the country. After a long battle with Hodgkin&apos;s disease, August Holland died on August 28, l998.<br>
Beautiful cool blue and purple hues are used throughout this well preserved and richly saturated print. The placement of the birds, combined with the atmospheric perspective and cool against warm contrast make this picture very pleasing to the eye. <br>

The Glasco 50 was built for dispensing bottles of Coca-Cola. This machine operated manually by opening the lid and sliding the bottle to the opening in order to remove it. The bottle was released once the coin was deposited into the coin box. This is a slider-style chest cooler that had the capacity to dispense 50 bottles and pre-cool 25. It was touted as being both compact and counter-high. It was also promoted as a soda vendor that could hold up to five different products. The slider had 5 rows that could each be filled with a different drink selection. It could hold regular or king-size bottles. <br>
<br>
This Coca Cola slider is in excellent condition, has the original keys and locks.  This Coke machine can hold Coke bottles, beer bottles, water bottles, etc.  Any bottles with a neck can be loaded into this machine and server ice cold. All for the price of 10 Cents.",

From Sea to Shining Sea Lighthouse August Holland <br>

<br>
August Holland was born June 23, 1928 in Sublette , Illinois . <br>
Holland&apos;s interest in art began at about the age of six. At the age of fifteen August&apos;s first published work appeared in &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine. After high school he went to the American Academy of Art in Chicago. When he finished art school, a job was waiting for him at an advertising agency in Mendota. Spare time was devoted to fine art. Two years later he was called into the service. Being an artist, he was asked to do the art work for propaganda to the Latin American countries. His first one-man show was held at the El Panama Hotel, and several months later he had another one-man show at the Jewish League in Panama. After his tour of duty, August returned to Mendota.<br>
During his early years as an artist, he was in the Ivan Soritch Gallery and the Edgewater Beach Gallery in Chicago. Goes Lithographing in Chicago liked his work and commissioned him to do many paintings. August had many pseudonyms from Boise Smith to Sasha Khomoran. Holland&apos;s work has been exhibited in several galleries across the country. After a long battle with Hodgkin&apos;s disease, August Holland died on August 28, l998.<br>
Beautiful cool blue and purple hues are used throughout this well preserved and richly saturated print. The placement of the birds, combined with the atmospheric perspective and cool against warm contrast make this picture very pleasing to the eye. <br>

August Holland was born June 23, 1928 in Sublette , Illinois . <br>
Holland&apos;s interest in art began at about the age of six. At the age of fifteen August&apos;s first published work appeared in &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine. After high school he went to the American Academy of Art in Chicago. When he finished art school, a job was waiting for him at an advertising agency in Mendota. Spare time was devoted to fine art. Two years later he was called into the service. Being an artist, he was asked to do the art work for propaganda to the Latin American countries. His first one-man show was held at the El Panama Hotel, and several months later he had another one-man show at the Jewish League in Panama. After his tour of duty, August returned to Mendota.<br>
During his early years as an artist, he was in the Ivan Soritch Gallery and the Edgewater Beach Gallery in Chicago. Goes Lithographing in Chicago liked his work and commissioned him to do many paintings. August had many pseudonyms from Boise Smith to Sasha Khomoran. Holland&apos;s work has been exhibited in several galleries across the country. After a long battle with Hodgkin&apos;s disease, August Holland died on August 28, l998.<br>
Beautiful cool blue and purple hues are used throughout this well preserved and richly saturated print. The placement of the birds, combined with the atmospheric perspective and cool against warm contrast make this picture very pleasing to the eye. <br>

https://everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac-core-i5-2.7-27-inch-aluminum-mid-2011-thunderbolt-specs.html :<br>
<br>
The iMac &quot;Core i5&quot; 2.7 27-Inch Aluminum (Mid-2011) is powered by a Quad Core 2.7 GHz Intel &quot;Core i5&quot; I5-2500S (Sandy Bridge) processor with a dedicated 256k level 2 cache for each core and a 6 MB shared level 3 cache. In lieu of a system bus, it has a &quot;Direct Media Interface&quot; (DMI) that &quot;connects between the processor and chipset&quot; at 5 GT/s.<br>
<br>
By default, it is configured with 4 GB of RAM (1333 MHz PC3-10600 DDR3 SDRAM), a 1 TB (7200 RPM) hard drive, a vertically-mounted slot-loading DVD/R DL &quot;SuperDrive&quot;, and AMD Radeon HD 6770M graphics with 512 MB of dedicated GDDR5 memory.<br>
<br>
It also has a built-in &quot;FaceTime HD&quot; video camera and built-in stereo speakers underneath the 27&quot; glossy 16:9 LED-backlit TFT Active Matrix LCD (2560x1440 native) display &quot;with IPS technology&quot;.<br>
<br>
Connectivity includes four USB 2.0 ports, a Firewire &quot;800&quot; port, built-in AirPort Extreme, Gigabit Ethernet, and an SDXC card slot as well as dual &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; ports that are backwards compatible with Mini DisplayPort and, likewise, each support an external display up to 30&quot; (2560x1600). Thunderbolt also supports other peripherals that use the Thunderbolt standard which provides up to 10 Gbps of bandwidth in both directions.<br>
<br>
Externally, the &quot;Mid-2011&quot; iMac line uses the same &quot;edge-to-edge&quot; glass design and &quot;seamless all aluminum enclosure&quot; as the &quot;Mid-2010&quot; models that came before them. Internally, however, the &quot;Mid-2011&quot; line is equipped with faster processors and faster graphics processors, as well as the aforementioned external improvements of a higher resolution (and wider angle) webcam and Thunderbolt.<br>",

It&apos;s in great shape with very little signs of use. It comes with the original box, cables, and is covered with AppleCare till October 2021. I&apos;m making the sad switch back to windows and thus selling this laptop since I don&apos;t use it much anymore. A refurbished model from apple without apple care would cost you at least $1800 and that&apos;s without tax too! This is a great deal for anyone in the market for a macbook pro.<br>

No issues at all functionally other than battery is old and only holds about 30 minutes of charge. Keyboard, trackpad, all ports, and the screen work perfectly. Cosmetically, there are some light scratches only on the bottom, and a couple nicks on the back next to the hinge. They are not visible from a normal using position. Minor issue is the rubber trim bordering the screen is old and slightly sticks when you close the lid.<br>
<br>
When this was bought new, it cost $3049 + tax!<br>
<br>
Comes with OEM power adapter with extended cable only.<br>
<br>
This is the highest spec of the mid 2012 retina models including the upgraded 2.7ghz quad core Intel core i7, the large 768gb flash SSD, and 16GB of RAM. It can still keep up with recent Macbook Pros in benchmarks such as Geekbench (multicore score is well over 10000). One of the best bargains for a powerful Apple laptop today!<br>
<br>
Has the older keyboard which many people prefer along with plenty of USEFUL ports. You won&apos;t need to carry around a plethora of dongles to use this! It also uses the older magsafe power chargers that disconnect harmlessly if someone trips on the cable for example.<br>
<br>
Specs:<br>
- 15&quot; Retina display<br>
- Quad core i7 2.7 GHz CPU<br>
- 16 GB RAM<br>
- 1GB VRAM (NVIDIA GT 650M)<br>
- 768GB SSD<br>
- 2 x USB 3.0 ports<br>
- 2 x mini displayport (thunderbolt) ports<br>
- HDMI port<br>
- SD card slot<br>
- Magsafe charging port<br>
- Headphone jack :)<br>
- Will have fresh install of OS 10.14<br>

<br>
This particular ThinkPad T450s UltraBook has been rarely used in our office with ThinkPad Pro Dock, external keyboard, mouse and large monitor attached as a guest computer, the cosmetic condition is new, no scratches or wear mark on keyboard, no marks on touchscreen glass, it is in absolutely mint condition.<br>
<br>
It has a 5th Gen Intel i7-5600U CPU@2.60GHz - the fastest UltraBook in its class; 8GB DDR3L 1600MHz RAM (upgradable to 20GB) and 256GB solid state (SSD) hard drive.<br>
<br>
Display is 14&quot; 16:9 (wider) IPS (In-Panel-Switching) touchscreen with Full HD (1920x1080) resolution, very bright - the IPS screen will allow nearly 180 degree view angle and vivid color; touch screen is just providing another level of convenience of operation.<br>
<br>
Other nice built-in features are: Intel I218-LM low power Gigabit Ethernet (RJ45) port; Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 2x2 wireless and Bluetooth 4.0 combo adapter; Intel HD Graphics 5500 video card which can support external analog monitor via VGA and digital monitor via Mini DisplayPort in a total of three independent displays!<br>
<br>
Built-in 720 HD Webcam; 4-in-1 SD Card Reader (SD/SDHC/SDXC/MMC); combo audio ear/mic connector; VGA and Mini DisplayPort for external monitors; one Always-on USB 3.0, one regular USB 3.0 ports.<br>
<br>
Dual batteries: one is internal 3 cell and one is swap-able external 3 cell, just like any other laptop battery. Both are in great conditions: it will last 5-6 hours on a charge.<br>
<br>
This package also comes with a ThinkPad Pro dock, which will provide more USB ports, HDMI and DisplayPort etc. for expansion in the office. With ThinkPad Pro dock, you can easily expand this UltraBook to a work station without messing with all the wiring etc. Lenovo 90w original power adapter is also included.<br>
<br>
Fresh installation of Windows 10 Pro 64bits, applied with latest greatest patches and updates, unit has passed Lenovo Vantage diagnostic test, everything works smoothly and very fast.<br>
<br>
We have also installed and licensed Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 Suite, which includes Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Access etc., no renewal or subscriptions required in the future.<br>
<br>
The price is $495 and that will include everything mentioned above: ThinkPad T450s UltraBook, ThinkPad Pro docking station and 90w original power adapter. Local pick up and cash only, no scams or PayPal please. If interested, please text or call at  
 or leave your email/phone number for quick reply. Thanks for looking.<br>

                  description: "These beauties don&apos;t come up for sale every day. This is your opportunity to own a rare and very well regarded pair of Stephens Trusonic Vintage Speakers. The 15&quot; Speakers inside the massive cabinets are model 150CX. <br>
<br>
These are matching serial numbers: 2030 &amp; 2031 <br>
<br>
My guess is that these were made in the late 50&apos;s. Could be wrong about this but these are old. This model is the same 15&quot; cone as the 150FR but these include the much coveted 5KT tweeters. Which I&apos;ve owned before and they are really one of a kind sound. Superb. <br>
<br>
The cabinets I don&apos;t think are original. Or maybe they are and the looks were just not important as they may have been used in a theater, behind the scenes. But the cabinets are big and they are heavy. Made of particle wood, ok construction and the speakers sure sound good in them. They measure: 31.5&quot;H x 18&quot;W x 16.25&quot;Deep. <br>
<br>
The condition of these very old speakers is good to above average. Especially considering their age. The back are especially clean, they may have lived their entire lives inside this cabinet. The cones do show some signs of stains, some marks. No holes or tears to the paper cones. The surround material is intact, no holes or tears. <br>
<br>
Both speakers are tested and they are both working perfectly. Both woofer and tweeter sound fantastic. The high adjustments/crossovers will need some cleaning as they have some dead areas when turned. Also one of the adjustment knobs is missing. <br>
<br>
I am asking $1000 OBO for these rare beasts. I am in no way emotionally attached to these, need them gone. But I&apos;m also not trying to give them away. So please be reasonable with your offers. I just don&apos;t want to ship something like this and am willing to accept less if someone picks these up from my home. <br>

These are the best speaker under $500.00. I went to listen to these speakers 3 times before ordering them. I auditioned jazz,classical,and my favorite ROCK! They enhanced the sound of each musical style. I am also using them for home theater,and they sound great with my surround system.<br>

                  description: "Rarely used set of speakers. Works and sounds beautifully amazing! Speakers and electrostatic panels sound great and do not have any issues. Sorry, I cannot get pictures of the crossover mechanisms inside as the back panel is sealed in. These are customized built cabinets, but do not have speaker grills so you can finish the project and create your own grills.  Each speaker measures: 17.5&quot; wide x 11.25&quot; depth x 21.25&quot; tall<br>
<br>
These are amongst the Z-Series Z-220 models. All the early Janszen speaker systems followed the acoustic suspension principle of using a highly compliant, long throw woofer in a small sealed enclosure. If you opt for a smaller bass/midrange speaker, to enable a bookshelf size cabinet to be used, there will most likely be changes needed to the crossover network to match the drivers. It is normal to expect a loss of sensitivity by using smaller drivers in a reduced size of enclosure, nevertheless a good (say)165mm D with a vented box designed using the T &amp; S parameters may well give better results than the current arrangement.<br>
<br>
Rich sounding, the JansZen speakers can only be described as a superb loudspeaker whose musical response is indeed as clear as light. These are pre-Heil speakers in addition to Trans Nova, Magneplaner, Transtatic, Martin Logan Acoustat era speakers.<br>",

The camera comes with the battery, charger, and even an extra charger in case you want to keep one in your car or at work.<br>

The GFA 2535 is really two GFA-535s in one, with the flexibility to drive three or four channels. With individual level controls for precise control of each amp&apos;s volume, it&apos;s the ideal foundation for an authentic, ultra-realistic surround sound theater system, or for a multi-room or multi-speaker audio system.<br>
A single switch on the GFA-2535&apos;s rear panel lets you select 4-channel operation, or bridge two of the channels for a 3-channel configuration. In the 3-channel mode, the GFA-2535 brings your home theater to life, delivering 200 watts of clean, distortion-free sound to the center channel, and 60 watts to each of the rear channels. Add it to your existing 2-channel amplifier and you&apos;ll be at the center of a superbly balanced, awesomely powered stage with sound so real you can practically touch it.<br>
For audio applications, the GFA-2535 in the 4-channel mode acts as a pair of 60 watts-per-channel amplifiers to drive two sets of speakers. With two of the channels bridged, it delivers 60 watts each to a pair of satellites, and 200 watts to a single subwoofer for an incredible display of musical strength so real you definitely can feel it.<br>
Three channels or four, home theater or home audio, the award-winning Adcom GFA-2535 gives you twice the versatility of ordinary amplifiers. And twice the value that has made Adcom famous.<br>

  The Celestion Ditton speakers each measure 35.6 cm wide by 27.9 cm deep by 81.3 cm high. They come in the floor-standing tower form and weigh approximately 22 kg each. Hence, they require some extra room to accommodate. The Celestion Ditton 25 main speakers feature an RMS power of 60 watts per speaker, and a peak power handling of 120 watts. Furthermore, these stereo speakers offer a frequency response that ranges between 20 Hz and 40 kHz, allowing each one to produce low bass sounds and higher treble sounds well. The high tweeters with these Celestion Ditton speakers are constructed from Mylar for enhanced strength and durability. The tweeters on the Celestion Ditton 25 main speakers are one of the best just one level below the fitton 66 <br>
<br>
 These stereo speakers feature an auxiliary bass radiator design, so they work best when played at high volumes and when connected to good-quality amplifiers. The Celestion Ditton speakers are also optimal for listening to classical music.<br>

Noise Canceling Technology<br>
<br>
Noise canceling headphones reduce ambient noise to provide a quieter environment for audio entertainment. The headphones have an inside microphone on each earpiece that works with electronic circuitry to create oppositely phased sound waves that reduce, or phase out, the ambient noise sound waves.<br>

Listen With or Without Noise Reduction<br>
<br>
Convenient dual-use capability gives you the option of listening to your music with or without the noise cancelation feature, so you can enjoy unaffected music in quiet environments. This also allows you to keep using your headphones (minus noise reduction) when the batteries run dry.<br>

The Accuphase T-101 tuner is considered to belong in the class of the best sounding analog tuners ever produced at any price!<br>

The tuner is very clean and presents quite nicely from the front, top, sides, and frame.  The interior looks very clean. All meters, knobs, and buttons were rebuilt and work as they should.<br>
<br>
I have had throughout the years ( and still own a few) Sansui, Kenwood tuners, and with the exception of the Sansui TU-X1 and the Marantz 10B this Accuphase T-101 beats them all in sound quality, selectivity and sensitivity! The reception is very smooth, organic and tubelike with great treble, midrange and bass. <br>

<br>
Preamplifier is In &apos;like new&apos; cosmetic and functional condition.<br>
<br>
Pioneer Elite C-90 was a twin-mono design with separate power supplies and circuitry for both left and right channels Included Phono Section. It was designed to handle state of the art audio inputs.<br>
<br>
Pioneer advertised their Elite line and explained their reason for being: &quot;They are elite because each is the finest most distinguished and most powerful representative in its category. These are no-compromise components designed to meet one specific criterion--to handle the tough musical demands of digital programs, and so reproduce every nuance of music as faithfully as current technology allows.&quot;<br>
<br>
The ELITE Reference line of stereo equipment was distinguished by heavy copper plated steel chassis, the finest internal audio parts, unparalleled specifications and the distinctive gloss black Urushi-finished front panels with gold trim and stunning polished rosewood side panels. They had looks and audio specifications that rivaled the esoteric and far more costly high-end components on<br>
<br>
The back panel featured RCA jacks that was spaced wide enough apart to permit the use of audiophile grade interconnect cables. There were two unswitched AC jacks and one switched AC jack for powering other components.<br>
<br>
A particularly nice touch was the visible copper plating for all nomenclature which duplicated the copper plated chassis appearance inside the unit.<br>",

Featuring a compact design, AirPort Express supports simultaneous dual-band 802.11n Wi-Fi. Set up your wireless network quickly and easily using your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, or PC. Create a network just for guests. Stream music to any room in the house. And print from any room in the house, too. All with fast wireless technology. <br>
<br>
Easy Wi-Fi setup using iPhone, iPad, or Mac. <br>
Connect your DSL or cable modem to AirPort Express and create your new wireless network in just a few taps from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. Or use the built-in AirPort Utility on your Mac. Setup is just as fast and just as easy. <br>
image.alt.mobile-overview-airexpress-2012-dual-band <br>
<br>
Simultaneous dual-band 802.11n. <br>
AirPort Express lets Wi-Fi-enabled devices connect to your network on the 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless bands. Which means every connected device automatically uses the best band available for the fastest possible performance. <br>
Stream music with AirPlay. <br>
AirPlay takes the music from the iTunes library on your computer or iOS device and sends it wirelessly to any connected stereo or speakers in your home (audio cable sold separately). Play music on one set of speakers -- or if you have more than one AirPort Express connected to speakers, play your music from iTunes on all of them at the same time. <br>
<br>
Print wirelessly from any room. <br>
On the back of AirPort Express is a USB port that&apos;s made for your printer. Just plug it in and instantly it&apos;s like having a printer in every room. And since AirPort Express works with Mac and PC, everyone in the house can take advantage of one centrally available printer. <br>
<br>
Compatibility and security. <br>
AirPort Express is compatible with devices using the 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n specifications. So no matter what Wi-Fi device you&apos;re using, it will work with AirPort Express. AirPort Express also features a built-in firewall to protect your network from malicious Internet attacks. The firewall is automatically turned on, so you don&apos;t have to do a thing.  <br>
<br>
Create a guest network. <br>
Set up a separate Wi-Fi network with a separate password just for your guests. Simply enable the guest networking feature, and your guests can access the Internet but not other parts of your primary network, such as your computers, printers, and LAN-attached hard drives.<br>",

I have most of my seed collection up for sale.  Everything is still in the original breeder packaging. They are vacuum sealed and placed in a fridge at 36 degrees. They are all regulars, meaning you can clone them and you can breed properly with them. No, I don&apos;t have feminized or autoflower.  Once you know how to clone for yourself, auto and feminized aren&apos;t cost effective. Most are no older than a year, but since I keep them vacuum sealed and in a fridge, age is not an issue. I&apos;m happy to answer questions, however I am a very busy person. If your not serious about a purchase, please don&apos;t waste both of our time. Minimum order is $100. <br>

<br>
FROM SOLSOLUTIONS      www.sol-solutions.com<br>
<br>
SolSolutions Emerald Glow LED Grow Strips are the best in class low voltage, super efficient and powerful LED grow lights. These LED Grow Strips have a high color rendering index (CRI), which is a real full spectrum of white light, as well as a great color temp, with a specific use in high-grade horticulture.<br>
<br>
LED Grow Strips are IP66 rated and completely waterproof, with total submersion in water possible. They can be used for complete replacement of florescent T-5 fixtures or HPS/metal halide lights and use half the energy of a florescent T5.<br>
<br>
Emerald Glow LED Grow Strips are perfect for inside vegging to grow moms, clones, or any starts in a completely controlled environment. They can also be used for greenhouse season extension and lighting supplement to increase your production and growth cycle. This assists your plants, especially in the off-season and lower light conditions, to continue to grow at their peak potential.<br>
<br>
These LEDs are prime for extensive inside or greenhouse commercial installs where you need coverage for a bigger space. The low voltage means you can run several strips safely when combined with drivers (required and sized to strip volume) and light-gauge wire.<br>
<br>
Grow Strips allow you to do a variety of hanging and install setups. They are the absolute best option for NEC compliant wet location electrical installation.<br>
<br>
SolSolutions offers our LED Grow Strips in two sizes of Emerald Glow Clone Rack Kits, three sizes of Emerald Glow Hanging Fixture, or as part of custom designed systems to work for your needs (custom pricing based on coverage area and setup)<br>
<br>
Emerald Glow 4&apos; Grow Strip Specifications:  IP66 Rated,  24 Watts,  96.2 CRI,  5000 Kelvin Color temp<br>

 I have no history for the rim. It is a double wheel and it reads 21 &quot; on the tire. The inside rim is welded in several places to the outside rim it  could easily be separated with a hand grinder.   The inside wheel has no spokes<br>
 The rim could be used in a  garden.  a decoration, plant succulents around it. <br>
It is heavy and lying flat it is very stable, outside the garden it would make an excellent base for a vise, grinder, etc.<br>
I have read online wire wheels are used as a  component in  hanging light fixtures. It would make a great base for a small table<br>
 It is very unique piece. I am firm on the price. <br>

How to Cook Chicken in a Schlemmertopf Pot<br>
by  FRED DECKER Oct. 03, 2017<br>
How to Cook Chicken in a Schlemmertopf Pot<br>
<br>
A variety of clay roasting or baking pots are used in cultures around the world for preparing foods in gentle, moist heat. Unglazed terra cotta cookers absorb moisture from the food and release it slowly to the outside, slowly concentrating the cooking liquids. Glazed clay cookers trap the steam inside, but allow some to escape from vent holes or deliberately loose-fitting lids. Glazed cookers, such as the German-made Schlemmertopf, are more sanitary, since they don&apos;t absorb any juices from the food as it cooks.<br>
Video of the Day<br>
Step 1<br>
<br>
Rinse your chicken inside and out under cold running water. Then, pat it dry with clean paper towels.<br>
Step 2<br>
<br>
Squeeze a half-lemon over the chicken, rubbing the juice into its skin. Season the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper, and sprinkle it with the leaves from two sprigs of thyme. Put two more sprigs of thyme into the cavity, along with the squeezed-out lemon half.<br>
<br>
Step 3<br>
<br>
Soak the top of the Schlemmertopf in cold water for 10 to 15 minutes. Place the chicken in the Schlemmertopf, and replace the freshly soaked lid.<br>
Step 4<br>
<br>
Place the Schlemmertopf on the middle rack of your cold oven. Turn the oven to 375 degrees F, and close the door.<br>
Step 5<br>
<br>
Roast your chicken in the Schlemmertopf for 90 minutes. Carefully remove the roaster from your oven, and place it on a trivet on the counter. Remove the lid, taking care to avoid the billow of hot steam that will escape.<br>
Step 6<br>
<br>
Remove the chicken from the Schlemmertopf and cover it loosely with aluminum foil. Let the bird rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving and serving it.<br>
Things You&apos;ll Need<br>
<br>
    1 roasting chicken<br>
    Paper towels<br>
    1/2 lemon<br>
    Salt and pepper<br>
    Fresh thyme<br>
    Trivet<br>
    Aluminum foil<br>
<br>
Tips<br>
<br>
    With any clay roaster, it&apos;s very important not to allow sudden temperature changes. Don&apos;t put your Schlemmertopf into a preheated oven, especially if it&apos;s got a cold bird inside. When you take your roaster from the oven, set it on a trivet or cooling rack, not on a cold counter. Never pour hot water in a cold Schlemmertopf, or cold water into a hot one. Any of these errors can cause your roaster to crack. Soak both halves of your Schlemmertopf in water for 30 minutes the first time you use it. After that, soak the top only for 10 to 15 minutes before each use.<br>

Some have small imperfections, all are original Caleca pieces, perfect for your Tuscan kitchen!<br>
<br>
_____________<br>
Caleca manufactured quality ceramic products for more than 200 years. Caleca Italia developed a low porosity, extra strong, but lighter ceramic body comparable to stoneware, vitreous and porcelain, rendering the Caleca products highly resistant to chipping with prolonged usage. Born from an antique tradition of over two-hundred years, and created by artists of diversified nationalities, the Caleca dinnerware collections are the fruit of a perfect fusion of tradition, good taste and technology.<br>
Each piece was manufactured in Italy from a unique red clay found only in the region of the original Caleca factory. The pieces were then hand painted by skilled artisans. The special manufacturing process and high firing temperatures created dinnerware that was much more durable than typical European earthenware. Each piece received a stamp ensuring its authenticity. With or without the official seal, the brightly saturated colors and whimsically fresh patterns are instantly recognizable as Caleca designs.<br>
All pieces of Caleca dinnerware are dishwasher and microwave safe, lead and cadmium free, and oven safe to 400&#xB0;F.<br>
Hand-painted in Italy: casual, bright, festive.<br>
Heavy, chip-resistant stoneware.<br>
Dishwasher-safe for easy clean-up.<br>

It is a jewelry bracelet and dressier style. Links are easy to remove if needed. Made in Switzerland and limited produced edition. Saw a 2017 model from Cartier duplicating virtually same design selling from three to four digits. Original box and paperwork included. I know other Lucien Piccard watches can cost less, but because the designs are common. This one is in collectible category and still runs smoothly.<br>
<br>
This goldtone Lucien Piccard women&apos;s stainless steel watch has either never been worn or worn just once for few hours, then essentially remained in the original box with all the paperwork.  Face dial measurement is 1&quot;x3/4&quot; rectangle style. band width is 1/2&quot;. It is self winding, battery Analog. Just follow written instructions included to gently pull out the stem to update time, then push back in. Time accuracy is within split seconds per year, non-magnetic, shock resistant within normal wear.  Eventually, it will need another battery as do all battery run watches, but current battery is still good.  I will add a fresher battery if current one expires for your convenience. Original price was about $500.00  in the late 90&apos;s.  Exact currency of only $76. Contact: Liz.",

This is best intended for nylon string guitars yet I use mine for both my classical and my steel string acoustic and it works fine.<br>

Used in all styles of music, the HD-28V offers the deep bass response that&apos;s made Martin dreadnoughts so popular. Yet it also has a high-end presence that sings out even in heavy instrumentation. You&apos;ll love the gorgeous sound of the classic tonewood combination of sitka spruce top and rosewood back and sides. The Martin HD-28V is both loud and subtle, and has a quick response with excellent note definition.<br>
<br>
The HD-28V is the Martin most popular Vintage Series model, a modern re-creation of the classic herringbone Dreadnought. This guitar includes a professionally installed LR Baggs Lyric internal pickup, and a bone strap button with faux tortoise dot inlay.  The guitar has very little use and it is in mint condition.

                  description: "I bought this amp in 1993 from a small music store in Hollywood (Freedom Guitars on Sunset) to record some secondary tracks on my band&apos;s first album.  I&apos;ve had it ever since, but it hasn&apos;t gotten much use.  I didn&apos;t tour with it (I&apos;m a Marshall guy), and it&apos;s mainly been in a closet since 1998.  In May 2018, I had it serviced/repaired and it sounds better than ever and has a clean bill of health.  It sounds fantastic overall and the tremolo is really something to hear.<br>
<br>
There&apos;s some guy named Phil X on YouTube playing different guitars through these amps (old Magnatone 1x12s) and making them more popular.  He&apos;s also apparently involved with a reissue version (Evil Robot).    Google him to hear a similar amp, he typically cranks it and shows the harder side.  Also, at a lower volume/preamp signal, it has a sound in the neighborhood of an old Fender amp, but darker.  By bridging the two channels with a patch cable (see one of the photos), you can get a dirtier sound more like Phil&apos;s.  What&apos;s great about it is the ability to get a dirty or clean tone depending on how hard you pick.  The YouTube video linked shows a range of the cleaner sounds from the 413, but the sound on the video isn&apos;t that good.  IMO, it&apos;s the dirtier sound and the tremolo that is really special.<br>
<br>
It has an output for an external speaker which works great.  Also a jack for a footswitch for the tremolo.  I never had the footswitch.<br>
<br>
I have no idea whether this one is mostly original, although the speaker sure looks like it.  Definitely some new tubes over the years, but perhaps more (knobs replaced?).  I do know that, since I bought it in 1993, it has only been maintained, not modified.<br>
<br>
Obviously, it is cosmetically far from mint, but it is structurally sound and, as mentioned above, was recently repaired, with a couple of new tubes and a full checkup.  Everything works perfectly and it really rips.  Happy to answer any questions, but I don&apos;t have any real expertise in these old amps, so probably can&apos;t tell you too much more than I&apos;ve put in this ad.<br>",

                  description: "How to select a good erhu?<br>
In general, a better erhu (more expensive) has a larger python skin pattern.  First, you count the number of squares pattern across the skin drum (diagonally).<br>
Some of the concert grade erhu has 8 - 9 squares across the drum.  A cheap erhu sometimes has 20 small squares making the erhu resonance (sound) very poor.<br>
A professional erhu usually has 12 or less squares across the drum.  The larger the skin pattern (squares) the better sound the erhu produced, again in general.<br>
Next you consider the erhu wood. Sandalwood (&#x5370;&#x5EA6;&#x5C0F;&#x53F6;&#x7D2B;&#x6A80;&#xFF09;from India is the best choice than other wood but they are extremely expensive.  Ebony is also quite a good choice.  Other types of wood are less better choice for making erhu.<br>
<br>
This is a professional grade, sandalwood dragon head erhu (&#x5C0F;&#x53F6;&#x7D2B;&#x6A80;&#x9F99;&#x5934;&#x4E8C;&#x80E1;&#xFF09;<br>
Serial Number: SOG2017/03/06899&#x3002; You will get this erhu with this serial number.   Beware that many listings with nice and appealing erhu pictures but<br>
when you receive it, it is a different one.  With fixed serial number, and the listed snake skin pattern, you know what you order.  You won&apos;t receive a different kind,<br>
with a lower grade erhu, and if you try to return it,  it is too costly and too far away.  You stuck with the erhu you don&apos;t want.<br>
<br>
This erhu comes with<br>
1) professional erhu bow&#xFF08;&#x4E13;&#x4E1A;&#x4E8C;&#x80E1;&#x5F13;&#xFF09;<br>
2) tuners installed (&#x4E8C;&#x80E1;&#x5FAE;&#x8C03;&#xFF09;<br>

                  description: "This is a rare sight in the US...listed here is a Sugi NB4 (Night Breeze) Standard Series bass. This is a handcrafted boutique bass from Japan made by Makoto &quot;Nick&quot; Sugimoto, who is well-known for his innovations in Fujigen producing iconic high-end instruments like the Ibanez Prestige and the Ibanez Jem. Sugi is his original brand for guitars and basses; with his reputation as one of Japan&apos;s most esteemed builders, there is no question that his instruments boast the quality and standards to bear his name. <br>
<br>
The Night Breeze is Sugi&apos;s flagship line for basses, proudly crafted in Japan. The bass is in excellent cosmetic condition and well-cared for. Needless to say, it is a beautiful instrument with a lot of heft and substance to offer. Best of all, it is blissfully versatile. If I can describe it, the Sugi NB has a fundamentally jazz bass flavor, but with extra warmth that can range anywhere from being crisp and clear to woody with a nice throatiness. Low action, and the neck plays like a dream (not to mention the beautiful wood grain pattern on the fretboard!). <br>
<br>
Only selling this one because I already own a second Sugi, and I could use the funds for my upcoming custom order.<br>
<br>
Specs below:<br>
<br>
Body : Swamp ash<br>
Neck : Aqua Timber Maple(center) &#xD7; Maple 5P Neck<br>
Fretboard : Flamed Maple <br>
Active Bartolini 2-band preamp <br>
Control : 2 Volume, 1 Tone<br>
Tuning Machines : GOTOH GB350<br>
Bridge : GOTOH 404 BO-4<br>
Hardware Color : Gold<br>
Finish : Solid Black Body, Natural Finish Neck<br>
Sugi Abalone Bat Inlay<br>
---<br>
<br>
Imported to the US new, this bass would run at $3,500-$4,000 + international shipping + import tax. You could save yourself from all of that hassle with this bass I&apos;m selling for $1,900. Price is fair and firm. G&amp;L semi-hard molded case for jazz basses included. <br>
<br>
Available to anyone who can meet me locally; I cannot ship or deliver. In addition, payment will be accepted in cash only. Trades will not be considered unless you&apos;ve got another bass so unique or exquisite - and of equal or greater value - that I can&apos;t refuse. Been plenty impressed by the Sugi already ;) .",

                  description: "How to select a good erhu?<br>
In general, a better erhu (more expensive) has a larger python skin pattern.  First, you count the number of squares pattern across the skin drum (diagonally).<br>
Some of the concert grade erhu has 8 - 9 squares across the drum.  A cheap erhu sometimes has 20 small squares making the erhu resonance (sound) loud, but not mellow and very poor.<br>
A professional erhu usually has 12 or less squares across the drum.  The larger size of the skin pattern the better sound the erhu produced, again in general.<br>
Next you consider the erhu wood. Sandalwood (&#x5370;&#x5EA6;&#x5C0F;&#x53F6;&#x7D2B;&#x6A80;&#xFF09;from India is the best choice than other wood but they are extremely expensive.  Ebony is also quite a good choice.  Other types of wood are less better choice for making erhu.<br>
<br>
This is a professional grade ebony erhu, brand new&#xFF08;&#x9ED1;&#x6A80;&#x4E13;&#x4E1A;&#x4E8C;&#x80E1;&#xFF09;<br>
<br>
You will get this erhu with this snake drum pattern and the erhu maker &#x738B;&#x7389;&#x4EC1;&#xFF08;please see the attached picture&#xFF09;&#x3002;<br>
Beware that many listings posted with nice and appealing erhu pictures but when you receive it, it is a different one.  <br>
With this snake drum pattern and the maker&apos;s name posted in this listing, you know what you get.<br>
<br>
This brand new erhu comes with<br>
1) professional erhu bow&#xFF08;&#x4E13;&#x4E1A;&#x4E8C;&#x80E1;&#x5F13;&#xFF09;<br>
2) tuners installed (&#x4E8C;&#x80E1;&#x5FAE;&#x8C03;&#xFF09;<br>
3) noise suppressor installed (deer skin, replacing the sponge&#xFF0C; &#x57AB;&#x97F3;&#x5668;)<br>
4) erhu bridge, professional grade, &#x4E09;&#x901A;&#x4E8C;&#x80E1;&#x7434;&#x7801;, include with another extra erhu bridge<br>
5) professional set of erhu strings installed,  include with another set of strings (&#x864E;&#x4E18;&#x4E13;&#x4E1A;&#x7434;&#x5F26;&#xFF09;<br>
6) erhu case &#xFF08;&#x4E8C;&#x80E1;&#x76D2;&#xFF09;<br>
7) rosin (&#x677E;&#x9999;&#xFF09;<br>
<br>
I have tested this erhu and it produces a loud, clear and distinctive erhu sound. <br>
<br>
I also sell the ebony erhu with a dragon head, professional grade, &#x9ED1;&#x6A80;&#x9F99;&#x5934;&#x4E13;&#x4E1A;&#x4E8C;&#x80E1;, priced at $515.00.  It also comes with the above accessories.<br>

<br>
The best of all Tritons ever produced, the Extreme. Top of the line model that replaced Triton Studio, loaded with ton of new sounds and features. Extreme has doubled the polyphony (120 voices), expanded waveforms set (initial multisounds) to a whopping 160Mb (4x times the Triton Studio) and all EXB expansion cards are already installed in onboard ROM memory. For reference, the legendary KORG M1 had only 4Mb wave ROM, so you can imagine how much more power Triton Extreme has! Patch storage capacity was expanded too, it has an insane amount of preloaded sounds: 1536 programs and 1536 combinations! These are all preloads, not presets, means that you can overwrite any of them if you don&apos;t need that sound and put your own at that program number.<br>
<br>
If you are in cover or tribute band playing a typical 80s-90s &quot;club mix&quot;, the Extreme will give you all the sounds you need: every top band of the last 20 years used KORG Tritons. Jonathan Cain of &quot;Journey&quot; used it at their last 2018 tour! It&apos;s very warm and analog sounding instrument, all signature sounds of the classics are here: Juno and Jupiter pads, Oberheim strings, Moog, MS and Polysix leads, and so on.

Dual polyphonic arpeggiators do make a difference, lets you create very complex motion structures that are tempo synched to internal or external MIDI clock. It&apos;s really an inspirational tool for songwriters, just play chords and it will produce a complete song in minutes. <br>
<br>
One of best features of Extreme is instant recording: if you came with some cool keyboard riff that you want to save, just press &quot;Enter&quot; and &quot;Rec&quot; at once, it will instantly switch to sequencer mode with all parts laid out as sequencer tracks, no need to set up a new song track-by-track the usual way. <br>
<br>
It has ton of inputs and outputs, USB (you can use it as master keyboard for playing software instruments straight from a laptop), sampler with a huge amount of sampling memory available (16 Gb, not Mb, more than in any other synth/workstation). You can record your own samples from audio inputs, or import any sample files via USB. It&apos;s a full-featured workstation with all signature KORG sounds that also easy fits to your DAW-based studio setup. <br>
<br>
Synth is in perfect working condition, all keys and panel buttons work, display is bright as new. End caps are a bit cracked but still hold together (which doesn&apos;t affect the sound in any way). You can buy the replacements online and install them yourself, I never bothered because it plays fine as-is.<br>
<br>
Selling it because I&apos;ve got Kronos and just don&apos;t need the Extreme anymore. My price is more than reasonable: they go for $1100-plus on eBay and Reverb, and price keeps going up, since they are no longer available as new. 76-key synths have the highest resale value, they are generally priced higher than 88-key. IMHO the 76-key is the best size for a synthesizer: not that small as 61-key (on those you&apos;ll be constantly running out of keys at the left), but not that bulky and heavy as the piano-action 88-key ones.<br>

Answers to the typical questions you may have:<br>
1. Triton Extreme is STILL AVAILABLE.<br>
2. Everything works 100%, can be tested any way you want.<br>
3. My &quot;best price&quot; is listed above. If it&apos;s not good enough, you are more than welcome to buy it online for $1100 and up. (keep in mind, online buys are always a cat in the bag!)",

                  description: "Nord keyboards have an extraorbital price tags, and for a reason: they simply sounds great! Yes, they are premium instruments for a real musicians, not wannabees. Ask everyone who owns Nord, and they would just explode about how they love it!<br>
<br>
Out of three main product lines (Stage, Piano and Electro) the Piano has the finest keyboard and the best piano sounds found in all electronic and digital pianos on the market. Other manufacturers may bullshit you with number of programs, abundance of knobs and buttons, etc, etc, but if you try it and hear the SOUND, you&apos;ll see the difference and why Nord can charge premium prices for their instruments. After all, it&apos;s what you expect from a digital piano, an authentic keyboard feel and authentic sound of a real acoustic grand piano, with all these subtle nuances that make a difference between &quot;real&quot; and &quot;like&quot;. Many manufacturers claim that their instruments sounds and feel like a real piano, but very few are actually similar to it. Nord Piano 3 is the only digital piano today that does it 100%, with no compromises (that&apos;s why it costs that much!).<br>
<br>
Here&apos;s an excellent demo showing all factory preloaded sounds (very long!). You have to listen through good headphones, to hear all these tiny details like string resonance and room response: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOkb1jkiPsE&amp;t=9211s<br>
<br>
Nord Piano 3 is pretty much the same as piano and sample synth sections of the newest Nord Stage 3 (sans the organ section with drawbars), but with more memory available for piano sounds. Nord was able to allocate more for piano sounds (1 Gb, more than in any other modern digital pianos), which means that Nord Piano 3 can use larger piano samples, with higher resolution and more sampling levels, which translates to a better sound. You can still load organ sounds as samples into synth section, usually enough for live work.<br>
<br>
The unique feature of Nord Piano 3 is its ability to download different piano and synthesizer sounds from Nord site (all free), so you are not stuck with pianos it came with. It&apos;s pretty much the same as downloading different programs and apps to a laptop, except you load them into Nord Piano. None of other synthesizers and pianos have this feature (with the exception of Korg Kronos, but that&apos;s a unique machine too, pretty much a soft synth, a PC running Linux OS). On all other pianos you just have sounds it came with, whether you like them or not, all those &quot;factory presets&quot; are there, taking memory space, you can&apos;t get rid of them. With Nord you can choose and load only what you like, and even choose between 4 different sample sizes for each sound, from S to XL. Besides superb pianos and e-pianos it also has plenty of synth sounds like bass, pads, strings, brass, etc., that can be layered with piano or split over the keyboard. You can have a standard jazz setup with piano at the right and acoustic bass at the left, or piano at the left and some synth lead at the right, or anything in between. <br>
<br>
https://www.nordkeyboards.com/downloads/downloads-nord-piano-3<br>
<br>
It also has the best hammer-action piano keyboard (made by Fatar for Nord). Fatar is known for its superb keybeds, but designers at Nord went one step further and made it perfectly calibrated for each individual instrument that leaves factory. Every keyboard has some imperfections in response, a bit uneven, no matter how good they are made. All brands have this problem, even the finest ones. <br>
<br>
The way Nord overcomes this problem with Piano 3 is that it employs a special chip where actual response of each key is recorded on a specially calibrated test bench (when each key is pressed with precisely the same force, more accurate than any human can do). All imperfections in response are later compensated by that chip so the response of each individual key of each Nord piano is perfectly even! No other manufacturer has anything similar in place, and that&apos;s why Nord keyboards are the best! Also, all Nords are hand made in Sweden, not mass-stamped in China.<br>
<br>
The exclusive Virtual Hammer Action Technology with Triple Sensor simulates the hammer movements in a Grand Piano, delivering outstanding authenticity and dynamic response. The Triple Sensor keybed allows key movements to be determined with stunning precision. The result is a keyboard action that handles dynamic playing with amazing control at any velocity level!  <br>
<br>
What&apos;s so special about that triple sensor? In short, keys remain fully sensitive even at softest pianissimo, allowing full expression play. Other pianos with only two sensors (high and low) often fail at this, producing sound either too loud or no sound at all when playing very soft.The Nord Virtual Hammer Action Technology enables you to produce a new note without lifting the key completely. This allows for smoother repetitions as the tone is not completely dampened between the strokes, similar to the fluent transitions possible on a real acoustic grand piano. Extended Triggering Range technology makes both top and bottom triggering possible, resulting in amazing control when playing percussively as well as pianissimo with the keys half-pressed down. <br>
<br>
Piano 3 keyboard is different from Stage and Electro HP models (those with piano-like action). Keys are longer with heavier response, so if you want the ultimate piano feel, you have to go with Piano 3. You may notice that Piano 3 is heavier than Electro HP models, because of those truly weighted keys, but still under 40 lbs, lighter than many competitors, such as Yamaha or Roland. Very easy to move around and it can be stored in the bag vertically when not in use.<br>
<br>
Too much features to describe here, watch online demos to learn more. Nord Piano is a rare instrument (after all, only the best musicians can afford it), so if you want to try it yourself, go to the Guitar Center and try Stage 3 HA88 (88-key, not the Compact): it has very similar keyboard and piano sounds (at $4449+tax price, which will be close to $5000).  The only thing that&apos;s missing is organ sounds, but if you are primarily a piano player, you won&apos;t miss much and save a lot by going with Piano 3 instead of Stage 3, for half of the Stage 3 price. Frankly Nord Stage 3 is not a full-blown synthesizer as you may think, its synth section is pretty limited, with minimal control over sound parameters, compare to real synths like Kronos or Montage. You can&apos;t do any serious &quot;sound crafting&quot;, in synth sense: waveforms, filters, modulators, etc. Many pros I know pair their Nord Piano or Stage models with a real synthesizer like Korg Triton, Yamaha Motif or Montage, Roland Fantom that can be found for under $1000.<br>

This Piano 3 is in excellent, brand new condition, not even a single scratch anywhere! Was used at home only, never taken out of the room. Can be tested however you want. All other Nord Pianos you may see online are priced higher and there&apos;s no guarantee that it will be as clean and spotless as mine. Usually they have dents and scratches, what&apos;s still considered &quot;like new&quot; by some sellers. Online stuff is always a cat in the bag. My price is a fair value of this piano, they are priced higher elsewhere (add sales tax and shipping to online prices!), and there aren&apos;t many used ones available.<br>
<br>
Comes with standard X-stand and optional Nord triple pedal. Selling it only because I have a few other 88-key pianos and frankly I need more universal machine like Kronos. No room for another full-sized piano.<br>

                  description: "Brand new Yamaha TF1, the hottest digital mixer of today. Was bought for a church upgrade project that decided to go with a larger QL5 desk at the last moment (a $12K console), mixer was past 30-day return policy, so it&apos;s for sale now. Desk is in absolutely new spotless condition, never been installed, gigged, rented out or used anyhow, just tested upon receipt to make sure everything works.<br>
<br>
TF1 is the smallest of all TF mixers, but it can control the same number of inputs as TF3 and TF5, in a smaller footprint. It also fits in a standard 19&quot; rack, as shown. Internal processors are the same in all three mixers, so they all sounds the same.<br>
<br>
Features at a glance:<br>
- 36 input channels (20 onboard, 36 via Dante card or USB from laptop)<br>
- 20 monitor mix buses (pre-configured as 8 mono mixes for floor wedge monitor speakers and 6 stereo mixes for in-ears). <br>
- 8 DCA groups (you can assign a similar inputs to each group, like keys, drums, guitars, backing vocals, etc, and control them with only one fader instead of many.<br>
- two master effects (all you typically need, reverb and delay)<br>
- graphic EQ on mains and mix buses (all mono mix buses already have GEQ inserted, no need to waste insert effects for that).<br>
- multi-gesture touch screen (means you can drag, drop, pinch, zoom like on iPad). All other touch screen mixers are touch-only: you can select parameter on touch screen, but must turn the knob to change the value.<br>
- channel preset libraries (just select the type of input: kick, snare, toms, guitars, keys, male and female vocal, etc.)<br>
- patented &quot;1-knob&quot; parameter setting. You can adjust the intensity of EQ, compressor, gate, etc. with just one knob, changing a few parameters at once for particular input, like vocal or guitar.  You can switch to full control over each parameter if you wish, like gain, frequency, Q (bandwidth), compressor threshold, attack, release, etc.<br>
- built-in RTA spectrum analyzer. Indispensable when killing feedback, shows the offending peaks right on the screen, overlaying the GEQ.<br>
- 34x34 USB recording interface: you can record each channel input plus main L/R as a separate tracks to a laptop with any DAW: ProTools, Logic, Ableton, Reaper, etc. You can record your band&apos;s gig and later turn it into demo track for Facebook, SoundCloud, etc.<br>
<br>
Too many features even to list here, watch YouTube videos to learn more. TF1 is the easiest digital mixer to work on, even untrained church volunteers can mix on it in no time. <br>
<br>
My price is more than reasonable for TF1 in brand new condition: the cheapest price I saw online was $1999 plus tax at Sweetwater, which brings it to $2200, so you can save at least $600 going with mine.<br>

                  description: "This is a brand-new unused high-quality top-of-line hardshell ABS Molded Guitar Case from Gator Cases that goes for $130 new.<br>
<br>
The model number is GC-ELEC-XL ABS. It did not fit my Danelectro Baritone Guitar, so I have no use for it unfortunately -- it turns out it is intended for longer scale &quot;heavy metal&quot; guitars that are 7-or-8-string models or 6-string models that are down-tuned from &quot;E&quot; to &quot;D&quot; or &quot;C&quot;, as opposed to traditional Baritone Guitars that are as long as short-scale basses (30&quot;) and tuned to &quot;B&quot; or &quot;A&quot;.<br>
<br>
It is OK to put a regular guitar in the case, and I could&apos;ve done that with my bag-only Yamaha RevStar, but don&apos;t feel comfortable with too much play in the headstock or it hitting too close to the neck in terms of the mid-section of the case vs. the cavity for the headstock. Some say this is a good case for SG type guitars though.<br>
<br>
I think it is intended for Ibanez and Schecter/ESP type 7-string and 8-string models mostly (which tend to be closer to 27&quot;-28&quot; scale and thus need a bit more length inside the case than a Les Paul or even a Stratocaster).<br>
<br>
Int Overall Length: 42&quot;<br>
Int Body Length: 18.75&quot;<br>
Int Body Depth: 3.5&quot;<br>
Int Lower Bout Width: 12.75&quot;<br>
Int Middle Bout Width: 12.75&quot;<br>
Int Upper Bout Width:	12.75&quot;<br>
Exterior Length: 43.5&quot;<br>
Exterior Width: 15.5&quot;<br>

<br>
I took my own measurements just now, as Sweetwater&apos;s might be off and are incomplete. The body section is about 18.5&quot;, the neck support is roughly 14.25&quot;, and the head cavity is about 8.75&quot;. The body cavity is 12.5&quot; wide, and the headstock cavity is 13.25&quot; wide so that splayed headstocks are more likely to fit.<br>",

<br>
There are only a few people who make these extra-tiny models, which are meant to serve both as a travel instrument as well as a higher-pitched voice in an ensemble as they can be tuned higher even than a Walaycho/Hualycho or standard Charango.<br>
<br>
Due to the small size, it is also cost-effective to use a quality Peruvian Walnut as the main wood. The fingerboard is said to be ebony but I&apos;m not sure I believe that; I think the South Americans use the term to indicate it is stained black. It is VERY dense though so maybe it is ebony.<br>
<br>
The sound of this instrument is VERY focused. You can hear some audio examples on YouTube if you search for the instrument name, or at Charango Mall where I ordered it. These are around $300 new, and the case was $60. I have only played it twice -- I have very fat fingers so I find it too hard to finger precisely even for chords.<br>
<br>
Body length is roughly 14.43&quot;, bout/width is 7.08&quot; and scale length is just 7.875&quot;, with 12 medium frets and a 1.875&quot; nut width. Not a hindrance as charango family instruments use ukulele style re-entrant tuning and so most strings double other notes within the same octave. The manguerito especially is used mostly as a rhythm accent instrument.<br>
<br>
The top is called White Spruce Pine on everything I have ever ordered from Bolivia, so I think there are some translation challenges as the Spanish is clearer and it seems to be a European Spruce vs. a North American variety. Probably these all come in through Brasil as that country is closer to Europe than to us.<br>
<br>
I have it tuned as d4-g4-b4b3-e4-b4b4. Unlike the charango, only the first and third courses are doubled, but the third course is an octave apart just as on the charango. So this is a 7-string vs. 10-string instrument.<br>
<br>
It is strung up with Carlos Medina Artigas MA-1230 Black Nylon Charango Strings, from what they told me. My caliper measures .017&quot;/.017&quot;, .026&quot;, .032&quot;w/.017&quot;, .022&quot;, .028&quot;. That might be a little off, but it matches the string package specs.<br>

He was park photographer for the National Park Service in Yosemite Valley.  His books Point Reyes Visions and Visions of Marin was called the &quot;definitive visual history.&quot;  His work has often been featured by the Sierra Club, and on display at the Palace of the Legion of Honor,  the Peabody Museum at Yale, the Brooklyn Museum, the Asian Art Museum, and the Oakland Museum.  His work is in many private collections throughout the world.<br>
<br>
This particular work, Merced River by Cathedral Rock is considered one of his best works, and is a large format photolithograph made with an 8 x 10 size negative.  Very unique and shows such fine details not otherwise seen in smaler negatives.  He was certainly heavily influenced by Ansel Adams.  It was produced and signed by Richard Blair in 1988.  The frame was made by the artist and together they are a wonderful piece of art.  Blair produced this work when he was the Yosemite Valley park photographer.  It fully captures the beauty of the river and Cathedral Rock plus the calm and restfulness of the Merced River basin and the boldness and strength symbolized by Cathedral Rock.  A beautiful piece of work you would be proud to hang and enjoy in your home.",

It has TTL functions for Oly and Pana bodies (you can think of this flash is similar to Olympus FL-36r or FL-600R  without remote function). This flash is small but quite powerfull. <br>
<br>
It looks like new and works great. Reason for sale: I have acquired bunch of flashes to practice some strobism but cant find enough time (family+work). I have few other flashes for sale as well (Metz 44 AF-1 and other manual film era flashes) let me know if you are interested.<br>

I bought this from a leica dealership in almost new condition in 2011; so in the box you&apos;ll find the warranty card, manuals too. I&apos;ve put on one of the better leica R to canon EF mount adapters (leitax.com) with an AF confirmation chip (with fstop set to f2.8). Ive used this without issue on several canon bodies that Ive owned i.e. 1dmk4 and 5dmk3; so this lens is ready for use on canon EF mount cameras. One can refer to canon body compatibility at pebbleplace.com site. Lens model 11333 and made in Germany (see warranty card in pic). Note the lens can be easily returned to its original the leica R mount state thru the removal of EF mount adapter which is held in place thru several screws. Lens is in excellent condition and comes in the original box with case. Included too is BW 55mm protective filter which Ive always kept on the lens.",

The supports are solid enough to create a super still shot while light enough that you can pack it with you on a trip. I have had a great experience with this piece for years. This model is no longer being made but a comparable set up is still around two hundred dollars. The speed at which you can level your shot makes all the difference in the world.<br>

Canon XA10 Pro Camcorder Reviewed<br>
By Julie Babcock <br>
<br>
There&apos;s no denying it; the Canon XA10 is quite possibly the smallest professional camcorder to ever come through our doors. In a world where pro cams are distinguished by their larger form factors and multitude of exterior buttons, it quickly became obvious the XA10 does not play by the same rules.<br>
<br>
Pint-sized Appearance<br>
<br>
<br>
The body of the XA10 is certainly no larger than some of its consumer cam cousins, yet there are several external features that instantly set it apart. Perhaps the most obvious is the detachable handle, which is a nice inclusion as it provides another grip option for those handheld shots. Located towards the front of the handle there is an additional zoom control and a lockable start/stop record button, making those low angles a breeze to capture. However, what really makes the detachable handle spectacular are the two phantom powered XLR ports with manual audio controls and an external microphone mount. Being able to detach the handle is an added bonus when compact stow and travel is required.<br>
<br>
Small Camera, Big Heart<br>
<br>
<br>
The XA10 captures your images on a 1/3-inch CMOS Image Sensor, uses the AVCHD codec and records up to 24Mbps with a 4:2:0 color space. The 10x HD Zoom Lens offers a 35mm equivalent of 30.4mm - 304mm and combined with an 8-blade iris, delivers great looking images. Options in frame rates (60i, 30p Progressive, and native 24p) give you flexibility whether you&apos;re shooting for the web or want to give your video a more film-like look.<br>
<br>
Canon has managed to squeeze in a multitude of features that any pro videographer would insist on having. The Touch LCD display is your go-to place for nearly every function the camera features. Often, functions located in an LCD menu are a nuisance to access, especially while trying to shoot, but the XA10 makes it easy. Once visiting a function, a shortcut button appears on the LCD display. The shortcut made readjustments to our settings a snap and decreased the overall setup time. Another great feature for image adjustments is the Custom button and dial, located on the rear exterior of the camera. When in manual mode, the Custom button allowed us to adjust shutter speed, iris, and exposure while recording, which is extremely helpful when shooting conditions change suddenly. However, when shooting in Av (Aperture Priority) or Tv (Shutter Priority) modes, the Custom button is limited to adjusting only the iris or the shutter speed, respectively.<br>
<br>
Having crisp and clear focus of your subjects is extremely important in video production and the XA10 gave us plenty of options in obtaining this goal. The focus ring on the front is a great start. Focus Assistance, once turned on, is activated every time you move the ring. It provides 2x magnification, which allowed us to easily achieve sharp focus. An edge monitor waveform display, color peaking and a focusing distance display also aid in achieving impeccable focus. Touch focus, Face Detection and Touch &amp; Track helped us focus while saving on set-up time, which is great for run and gun shooting.<br>
<br>
Along with full manual control of the iris, shutter speed and exposure, zebra stripes and a waveform monitor assist in achieving accurate exposure. To ensure your colors are always represented accurately, white balance options are available in auto, presets, custom settings and Kelvin settings that allow you to adjust white balance in-100 degree increments between 2,000K and 15,000K. SMPTE standard color bars and tone (-12dB, -18dB, or -20dB tone) can also be added at a touch of a button.<br>
<br>
The XA10 has 64GB of internal flash memory providing almost six hours of recording on the highest quality setting (24Mbps) and over 24 hours at the lowest setting (5Mbps). If that&apos;s just not enough record time for you, the XA10 also offers two SD/SDHC/SDXC memory card slots. Relay Recording allows the camera to seamlessly switch from the internal memory to the SD memory cards when internal memory reaches full capacity. Additionally, the SD cards can be set for Double Slot Recording, which allows you to simultaneously record a backup of your work.<br>
<br>
Good Things Do Come in Small Packages<br>
<br>
While some might argue that the XA10 is just a beefed up version of Canon&apos;s higher end consumer models, it has plenty of features that will satisfy the professional looking for a camcorder at a lower price point while also providing those new to professional camcorders a healthy push in the right direction without feeling overburdened by too many controls or large form factors.<br>

I&apos;m selling my Contax 159 MM SLR 35mm film camera, with a Yashica 50mm f/1.7 lens. It works perfectly and takes beautiful photos. (See some sample images I shot/developed a month or so ago -- not saying I&apos;m a good photographer, but this camera does the trick!)

This is my personal order that I bought for my group. Although I&apos;m a pro raver and I&apos;ve been to 6 of the last 5 years (Yes I did doublechella in 2015 - worth it!) my group is opting to do Sundara in Mexico (Odesza addicts).<br>
<br>
Since the wristbands have not been shipped, we are able to move this from my account to yours.  We can meet in a public place or my office in Alameda to transfer (preferred since we&apos;ll have safe wifi and nobody around to see us count cash).  The tickets will ship directly to you.  Please have your FrontGate tickets account ready to go.  I cannot sell just one ticket or split it up.  THE ENTIRE ORDER WILL GO TO YOU WHEN TICKETS SHIP.  <br>
<br>
Cash in person/BTC preferred. No, I do not have paypal. <br>
<br>
The set is $2800. Price is firm. NO TRADES (nobody wants your leafy outdoor/concentrates or stolen laptops)! No lowballers.<br>
<br>
I can meet in Alameda/Oakland anytime. Don&apos;t hesitate to send me an email with your phone number so that we can link up!<br>

This is the BEST section of the Club Outfield category -- the per-ticket cost for seats across the aisle in CL207 are 35% higher than mine (you would pay $9,000 MORE PER SEASON for tickets in Club Infield 207-225 than for these on the 205/207 aisle, plus section CL205 is more competitive in the Giants resale consignment system, as they always show up first at the box office and sfgiants.com for searches in Club Outfield).<br>
<br>
This set of four seats together is in Club 205 Row J, on the aisle and literally right next to more-expensive Club Infield seats.  You get access to all Club concourses, lounges, bars, concierge, etc.   They are great company seats for entertaining clients and rewarding top performers.  Since CL205 is the best of the Outfield Club category, they rank at the top of &quot;Best Seats&quot; for category search.<br>
<br>
All 4 seats are under Price-Protection contracts limiting any price increase to 3-4% per year (one pair is on a max 3%/year agreement and the other on a max-4% agreement).  This also means that your per-ticket prices are much  lower than Club seats not under an agreement and WAY WAY lower than Box Office!<br>
<br>
I&apos;m asking $15,999 for the SET of 4 licenses.  I am the sole owner, so transfer is easy.  I have had Club seats at AT&amp;T for 14 years and counting.<br>

Access to Yahoo Sports Lounge and United Club. Special entrance - come early, stay late (wait for traffic to clear while you relax in the lounge).<br>

Deal would be done thru a private party transfer to save us both money on the fees associated with the sale. 49ers SBL members have to transfer the licenses through the STR marketplace.<br>

Catapults were first invented in Ancient Greek and Roman times, however our common idea of them is based on drawings we have from the Medieval Ages. Leonardo redesigned the catapult around 1485, and used the springlike energy stored in bent wood to give power to the swing arm.<br>
<br>
This catapult is a working re-creation of Leonardo da Vinci&apos;s 15th Century catapult. It is easy to make in about an hour and is made of natural untreated wood from sustainable forests.<br>
<br>
All pieces are pre-cut and ready to go. Some parts are pegged for extra strength.<br>

yellow), plus 8 Draw Two, Reverse and Skip cards in every color, along with 4
Wild Cards, 4 Wild Draw Four cards, 1 Wild Swap Hands Card and 3 Wild
Customizable cards. If you can&apos;t make a match, you must draw from the central
pile! Don&apos;t forget to shout &quot;UNO&quot; when you only have one card remaining! The

<br>
The children with the balloons wall decoration is all wood, and has new strings. It measures 8.75&quot; x 11&quot;, and has 2 triangular loops on the top for hanging.<br>
<br>
The circus tent with the large child is a musical crib decoration. The child spins around, winding a music box on the back. Made completely of wood, it has all of its original hardware to attach it to the crib safely and securely. It&apos;s 5.5&quot; x 5.5&quot; and is beautifully made.<br>
<br>
Two bookends also made of wood feature a girl in a pink kerchief washing, and a boy in a hat pushing a wheelbarrow. They are beautifully hand painted and measure 4.25&quot; x 4&quot; at the bottom.<br>
<br>
The Standing Rattle plastic toy is made by Waggie Wheels, but looks like a match for the Irmi set! It is hand painted, and measures 5.25&quot; x 3.5&quot;.<br>

The set is great for a nursery, child&apos;s room, playroom or grandma&apos;s house!<br>

Bring the action from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies to life with this &quot;My Size&quot; Hasbro Darth Vader action figure. Standing 31 inches tall, this figure is nearly life-sized and any child will enjoy facing off against Darth when he is on their level. Based mainly on &quot;Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith,&quot; this foreboding figure has seven points of articulation for lifelike positioning. A real fabric cape adds to the authenticity of this Hasbro figure, which also comes complete with a light saber. This is My Size&quot; Darth is a must-have for any collector, but is also a great gift for a young child aged 6 or above, or &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans of any age.",

Meet Spike, the dinosaur that kids bring to life at the touch of a button. He walks, he stands on his hind legs, he blinks, his mouth opens and closes, and his spikes even light up. You make it all happen with the easy-to-use remote control! Spike also makes lots of fun sounds, too. He growls, snorts, roars and more. Requires 3 &quot;AA&quot; alkaline batteries, included. Also uses rechargeable 9.6 Volt NiMH battery, 2 included (a $60 retail value)! Spike stands 27&quot; tall.",

A timeless shape brought to you by a neoclassic longboarder, the Wingnut Noserider Surfboard is the perfect choice for summer peelers. Incorporating the best qualities of the original Wingnut Model and the Mark Martinson Model, the Noserider has improved control, more stability and is a tipriding machine. The slightly pulled tail, in conjunction with softer rails, result in ultra-smooth turns and cutbacks that glean from Wingnut&apos;s decades of experience. With a true reverence for the art of traditional longboarding, the Wingnut Noserider will deliver a feeling like no other and have you paddling back out for more. Single Fin with Tail Block Standard.<br>

Excellent bike. I just received my 500 series MTB, it was everything I was expecting &amp; more. The bike arrived in perfect condition, the assembly was effortless. The customer service has been white glove, these guys have delivered on exactly what they promised. I was so delighted with the bike, I ordered a second one for my wife. Kevin and Jo-ann have done an outstanding job exceeding all my expectations. Thanks guys for delivering an awesome product.<br>

Wow, what a great product! Thank You for putting together such a great electronic bike at such a great price-point! I&apos;ve ridden bikes for almost 50 years and getting into the electronic bike arena was a stretch to my comfort zone, so I did a lot of research. You might find shops are trying to hit this $1k price with something, but they are certainly NOT this quality.<br>
Thank you for reminding me of how fun it can be to ride a bike as I now recall the thrill and exhilaration I felt when I first learned to ride. Over the years I&apos;d lost that. I&apos;ll be using this for most of my errands instead of hopping in my car as much as possible. And I love knowing I can use the electronic assist to get home if I get tired along the way.<br>
Additionally, Kevin is absolutely first class and is very responsive and ready to help, both pre-sale and post. He&apos;s definitely dedicated to your complete satisfaction.<br>

We bought 2 bikes. We are very satisfied with them, better than expected. Wed use them in the very hilly and mountainous area of the Berkshires and their performance was outstanding. Very comfortable ride. Pretty bikes. We had tested other bikes including the &quot;delivery&quot; bikes and some of the 3 - 4,000 range price and this is just bas good or better. The price is an astonishing bargain. Buy it now before they become one of the favorites at a much higher price. a minimal damage to one of them occurred during transportation and the owner paid for the repair immediately. I talked to him a very nice and responsible owner, a 100% behind his product<br>

Easy to assemble, intuitive to ride, and an all around blast. Can&apos;t stop riding. I use the pedal assist mode almost all the time which allows my bum knee to loosen up and get exercise. I haven&apos;t been able to ride my regular bike for years due to knee issues. Now I ride for hours every day and am loving it. FYI I am 70 years old.",

2010 K2 Apache Xplorer Description:<br>
&quot;The Xplorer made its debut in the Apache series last year and because of its versatility became an immediate success. Being the widest ski in the Apache line gives it an advantage in soft snow to help you track out the resort on those deep powder days but enough sidecut to lay down trenches across the corduroy on those groomer days as well. The broad range of versatility and high performance comes from a unique combination of an 84mm waist, metal laminate cap construction and generous 17/16 progressive sidecut that allows it to perform well on both soft and hard conditions.&quot;<br>

Water or snow beads up like a waxed car. Bag is the Tall size. This bag is designed for snow camping or just generally very cold conditions and will keep you warm down to 20 degrees below zero. I never snow-camped. I&apos;m just cold all the time and was able to sleep in shorts in this bag at 18 degrees F. <br>
<br>
I am disabled and have been selling many things recently. I am unable to handle the bag (hands/fingers too arthritic from Lyme disease) for washing it at a laundromat in a front loading machine, so it will need washing with the proper product. Nikwax makes one that is for cleaning and maintaining the Durable Water Repellency (DWR). It has always been stored in its storage bag (very large so the down is not compressed - a must for maintaining the loft).<br>
<br>
Like other items, I am using Google Images until I can photograph the bag. The bag is here with me, but bear with these photos until I post my own. <br>
<br>
I paid $699.00 for this bag new. It has no tears and no stains. The structural integrity of the bag is perfect. <br>

<br>
These like-new boots are about one year old with six snow days on them.  They have never been heat molded, so you can take them to a shop and get them custom fit to your feet.<br>
<br>
These are stiff, yet super comfortable boots that can go anywhere on the mountain. <br>
- Dual boas for precision fit<br>
- Elite fit inner boot.  Never heat molded and worn only six times, meaning you can get them heat molded to your feet.<br>
- Elite footbed with four different arch supports (all included).<br>
- Heel hold system with extra inserts<br>
- Removable boot flex inserts to adjust overall stiffness<br>
- Vibram outsole with sure-footed tread pattern and no appreciable wear<br>
- Boa replacement wire<br>
<br>
The only reason I am selling is because my friend gave me a great deal on some other boots and I don&apos;t need two pairs.  Have ridden these on a Burton Process Flying V and Burton Flight Attendant on groomers, pow and off-piste.  Great boots, good power to the edge of the board, stays comfy, never felt either too cold or too hot.<br>

One was used on a 1978 VW Rabbit but is fully adjustable for most cars and rests on the car roof on rubber feet and has door jamb tie downs. Asking $35.<br>
Sorry.. The BMW rack in the photo has sold and is no longer available. <br>

Why pay hundreds of dollars for new expensive racks. These work great and at a great price too.<br>
Make me an offer I can&apos;t refuse. They need to be used. <br>
Get these and go Skiing or use them as roof racks to haul your bike or kayak or ??? !<br>
